For instance, 5..1 indicates numbers 5 through 1 • is used to emphasize UNPREDICTABLE and UNDEFINED behavior, as defined below. 1.1.3 Courier Text Courier fixed-width font is used for text that is displayed on the screen, and for examples of code and instruction pseudocode. 1.2 UNPREDICTABLE and UNDEFINED The terms UNPREDICTABLE and UNDEFINED are used throughout this book to describe the behavior of the pro- cessor in certain cases. UNDEFINED behavior or operations can occur only as the result of executing instructions in a privileged mode (i.e., in Kernel Mode or Debug Mode, or with the CP0 usable bit set in the Status register). Unpriv- ileged software can never cause UNDEFINED behavior or operations. Conversely, both privileged and unprivileged software can cause UNPREDICTABLE results or operations. 1.2.1 UNPREDICTABLE UNPREDICTABLE results may vary from processor implementation to implementation, instruction to instruction, or as a function of time on the same implementation or instruction. Software can never depend on results that are UNPREDICTABLE. UNPREDICTABLE operations may cause a result to be generated or not. If a result is gener- ated, it is UNPREDICTABLE. UNPREDICTABLE operations may cause arbitrary exceptions. UNPREDICTABLE results or operations have several implementation restrictions: • Implementations of operations generating UNPREDICTABLE results must not depend on any data source (memory or internal state) which is inaccessible in the current processor mode ","1.3 Special Symbols in Pseudocode Notation The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 4 • UNPREDICTABLE operations must not read, write, or modify the contents of memory or internal state which is inaccessible in the current processor mode. For example, UNPREDICTABLE operations executed in user mode must not access memory or internal state that is only accessible in Kernel Mode or Debug Mode or in another process • UNPREDICTABLE operations must not halt or hang the processor 1.2.2 UNDEFINED UNDEFINED operations or behavior may vary from processor implementation to implementation, instruction to instruction, or as a function of time on the same implementation or instruction. UNDEFINED operations or behavior may vary from nothing to creating an environment in which execution can no longer continue. UNDEFINED opera- tions or behavior may cause data loss. UNDEFINED operations or behavior has one implementation restriction: • UNDEFINED operations or behavior must not cause the processor to hang (that is, enter a state from which there is no exit other than powering down the processor). The assertion of any of the reset signals must restore the processor to an operational state 1.2.3 UNSTABLE UNSTABLE results or values may vary as a function of time on the same implementation or instruction. Unlike UNPREDICTABLE values, software may depend on the fact that a sampling of an UNSTABLE value results in a legal transient value that was correct at some point in time prior to the sampling. UNSTABLE values have one implementation restriction: • Implementations of operations generating UNSTABLE results must not depend on any data source (memory or internal state) which is inaccessible in the current processor mode 1.3 Special Symbols in Pseudocode Notation In this book, algorithmic descriptions of an operation are described using a high-level language pseudocode resem- bling Pascal. Special symbols used in the pseudocode notation are listed in Table 1.1.

BigEndianCPU The endianness for load and store instructions (0  Little-Endian, 1  Big-Endian). In User mode, this endianness may be switched by setting the RE bit in the Status register. Thus, BigEndianCPU may be com- puted as (BigEndianMem XOR ReverseEndian). ReverseEndian Signal to reverse the endianness of load and store instructions. This feature is available in User mode only, and is implemented by setting the RE bit of the Status register. Thus, ReverseEndian may be computed as (SR RE and User mode). LLbit Bit of virtual state used to specify operation for instructions that provide atomic read-modify-write. LLbit is set when a linked load occurs and is tested by the conditional store. It is cleared, during other CPU operation, when a store to the location would no longer be atomic. In particular, it is cleared by exception return instruc- tions. I:, I+n:, I-n: This occurs as a prefix to Operation description lines and functions as a label. It indicates the instruction time during which the pseudocode appears to “execute.” Unless otherwise indicated, all effects of the current instruction appear to occur during the instruction time of the current instruction. No label is equivalent to a time label of I. Sometimes effects of an instruction appear to occur either earlier or later — that is, during the instruction time of another instruction. When this happens, the instruction operation is written in sections labeled with the instruction time, relative to the current instruction I, in which the effect of that pseudocode appears to occur. For example, an instruction may have a result that is not available until after the next instruction. Such an instruction has the portion of the instruction operation description that writes the result register in a section labeled I+1. The effect of pseudocode statements for the current instruction labeled I+1 appears to occur “at the same time” as the effect of pseudocode statements labeled I for the following instruction. Within one pseudocode sequence, the effects of the statements take place in order. However, between sequences of statements for different instructions that occur “at the same time,” there is no defined order. Programs must not depend on a particular order of evaluation between such sections. PC The Program Counter value. During the instruction time of an instruction, this is the address of the instruc- tion word. The address of the instruction that occurs during the next instruction time is determined by assign- ing a value to PC during an instruction time. If no value is assigned to PC during an instruction time by any pseudocode statement, it is automatically incremented by either 2 (in the case of a 16-bit MIPS16e instruc- tion) or 4 before the next instruction time. A taken branch assigns the target address to the PC during the instruction time of the instruction in the branch delay slot. In the MIPS Architecture, the PC value is only visible indirectly, such as when the processor stores the restart address into a GPR on a jump-and-link or branch-and-link instruction, or into a Coprocessor 0 register on an exception. Release 6 adds PC-relative address computation and load instructions. The PC value contains a full 32-bit address, all of which are significant during a memory reference. Table 1.1 Symbols Used in Instruction Operation Statements (Continued) Symbol Meaning ","About This Book 7 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 1.4 Notation for Register Field Accessibility In this document, the read/write properties of register fields use the notations shown in Table 1.1. ISA Mode In processors that implement the MIPS16e Application Specific Extension or the microMIPS base architec- tures, the ISA Mode is a single-bit register that determines in which mode the processor is executing, as fol- lows: In the MIPS Architecture, the ISA Mode value is only visible indirectly, such as when the processor stores a combined value of the upper bits of PC and the ISA Mode into a GPR on a jump-and-link or branch-and-link instruction, or into a Coprocessor 0 register on an exception. PABITS The number of physical address bits implemented is represented by the symbol PABITS. As such, if 36 phys- ical address bits were implemented, the size of the physical address space would be 2 PABITS = 2 36 bytes. FP32RegistersMode Indicates whether the FPU has 32-bit or 64-bit floating point registers (FPRs). In MIPS32 Release 1, the FPU has 32, 32-bit FPRs, in which 64-bit data types are stored in even-odd pairs of FPRs. In MIPS64, (and optionally in MIPS32 Release2 and Release 3) the FPU has 32 64-bit FPRs in which 64-bit data types are stored in any FPR. In MIPS32 Release 1 implementations, FP32RegistersMode is always a 0. MIPS64 implementations have a compatibility mode in which the processor references the FPRs as if it were a MIPS32 implementation. In such a case FP32RegisterMode is computed from the FR bit in the Status register. If this bit is a 0, the pro- cessor operates as if it had 32, 32-bit FPRs. If this bit is a 1, the processor operates with 32 64-bit FPRs. The value of FP32RegistersMode is computed from the FR bit in the Status register. InstructionInBranchDe- laySlot Indicates whether the instruction at the Program Counter address was executed in the delay slot of a branch or jump. This condition reflects the dynamic state of the instruction, not the static state. That is, the value is false if a branch or jump occurs to an instruction whose PC immediately follows a branch or jump, but which is not executed in the delay slot of a branch or jump. SignalException(excep- tion, argument) Causes an exception to be signaled, using the exception parameter as the type of exception and the argument parameter as an exception-specific argument). Control does not return from this pseudocode function—the exception is signaled at the point of the call. Table 1.2 Read/Write Register Field Notation Read/Write Notation Hardware Interpretation Software Interpretation R/W A field in which all bits are readable and writable by software and, potentially, by hardware. Hardware updates of this field are visible by software read. Software updates of this field are visible by hardware read. If the Reset State of this field is ‘‘Undefined’’, either software or hardware must initialize the value before the first read will return a predictable value. This should not be confused with the formal definition of UNDEFINED behavior. Table 1.1 Symbols Used in Instruction Operation Statements (Continued) Symbol Meaning Encoding Meaning 0 The processor is executing 32-bit MIPS instructions 1 The processor is executing MIIPS16e or microMIPS instructions ","1.4 Notation for Register Field Accessibility The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 8 R A field which is either static or is updated only by hardware. If the Reset State of this field is either ‘‘0’’, ‘‘Pre- set’’, or ‘‘Externally Set’’, hardware initializes this field to zero or to the appropriate state, respectively, on powerup. The term ‘‘Preset’’ is used to suggest that the processor establishes the appropriate state, whereas the term ‘‘Externally Set’’ is used to sug- gest that the state is established via an external source (e.g., personality pins or initialization bit stream). These terms are suggestions only, and are not intended to act as a requirement on the imple- mentation. If the Reset State of this field is ‘‘Undefined’’, hard- ware updates this field only under those conditions specified in the description of the field. A field to which the value written by software is ignored by hardware. Software may write any value to this field without affecting hardware behavior. Software reads of this field return the last value updated by hardware. If the Reset State of this field is ‘‘Undefined’’, soft- ware reads of this field result in an UNPREDICT- ABLE value except after a hardware update done under the conditions specified in the description of the field. R0 R0 = reserved, read as zero, ignore writes by soft- ware. Hardware ignores software writes to an R0 field. Neither the occurrence of such writes, nor the val- ues written, affects hardware behavior. Hardware always returns 0 to software reads of R0 fields. The Reset State of an R0 field must always be 0. If software performs an mtc0 instruction which writes a non-zero value to an R0 field, the write to the R0 field will be ignored, but permitted writes to other fields in the register will not be affected. Architectural Compatibility: R0 fields are reserved, and may be used for not-yet-defined purposes in future revisions of the architecture. When writing an R0 field, current software should only write either all 0s, or, preferably, write back the same value that was read from the field. Current software should not assume that the value read from R0 fields is zero, because this may not be true on future hardware. Future revisions of the architecture may redefine an R0 field, but must do so in such a way that software which is unaware of the new definition and either writes zeros or writes back the value it has read from the field will continue to work correctly. Writing back the same value that was read is guaran- teed to have no unexpected effects on current or future hardware behavior. (Except for non-atomicity of such read-writes.) Writing zeros to an R0 field may not be preferred because in the future this may interfere with the oper- ation of other software which has been updated for the new field definition.

Legacy “0” should not be defined for any new control register fields; R0 should be used instead. HW returns 0 when read. HW ignores writes. Only zero should be written, or, value read from reg- ister. pre-Release 6 pre-Release 6 legacy “0” - read as zero, nonzero writes UNDEFINED A field which hardware does not update, and for which hardware can assume a zero value. A field to which the value written by software must be zero. Software writes of non-zero values to this field may result in UNDEFINED behavior of the hardware. Software reads of this field return zero as long as all previous software writes are zero. If the Reset State of this field is ‘‘Undefined’’, soft- ware must write this field with zero before it is guar- anteed to read as zero. R/W0 Like R/W, except that writes of non-zero to a R/W0 field are ignored. E.g. Status.NMI Hardware may set or clear an R/W0 bit. Hardware ignores software writes of nonzero to an R/W0 field. Neither the occurrence of such writes, nor the values written, affects hardware behavior. Software writes of 0 to an R/W0 field may have an effect. Hardware may return 0 or nonzero to software reads of an R/W0 bit. If software performs an mtc0 instruction which writes a non-zero value to an R/W0 field, the write to the R/W0 field will be ignored, but permitted writes to other fields in the register will not be affected. Software can only clear an R/W0 bit. Software writes 0 to an R/W0 field to clear the field. Software writes nonzero to an R/W0 bit in order to guarantee that the bit is not affected by the write.

Following the figure are descriptions of the fields listed below: • “Instruction Fields” on page 12 • “Instruction Descriptive Name and Mnemonic” on page 12 • “Format Field” on page 12 • “Purpose Field” on page 13 • “Description Field” on page 13 • “Restrictions Field” on page 13 • “Operation Field” on page 15 • “Exceptions Field” on page 15 • “Programming Notes and Implementation Notes Fields” on page 15 ","","2.1 Understanding the Instruction Fields The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 12 2.1.1 Instruction Fields Fields encoding the instruction word are shown in register form at the top of the instruction description. The follow- ing rules are followed: • The values of constant fields and the opcode names are listed in uppercase (SPECIAL and ADD in Figure 2.2). Constant values in a field are shown in binary below the symbolic or hexadecimal value. • All variable fields are listed with the lowercase names used in the instruction description (rs, rt, and rd in Figure 2.2). • Fields that contain zeros but are not named are unused fields that are required to be zero (bits 10:6 in Figure 2.2). If such fields are set to non-zero values, the operation of the processor is UNPREDICTABLE. Figure 2.2 Example of Instruction Fields 2.1.2 Instruction Descriptive Name and Mnemonic The instruction descriptive name and mnemonic are printed as page headings for each instruction, as shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3 Example of Instruction Descriptive Name and Mnemonic 2.1.3 Format Field The assembler formats for the instruction and the architecture level at which the instruction was originally defined are given in the Format field. If the instruction definition was later extended, the architecture levels at which it was extended and the assembler formats for the extended definition are shown in their order of extension (for an example, see C.cond fmt). The MIPS architecture levels are inclusive; higher architecture levels include all instructions in pre- vious levels. Extensions to instructions are backwards compatible. The original assembler formats are valid for the extended architecture. Figure 2.4 Example of Instruction Format The assembler format is shown with literal parts of the assembler instruction printed in uppercase characters. The variable parts, the operands, are shown as the lowercase names of the appropriate fields. The architectural level at which the instruction was first defined, for example “MIPS32” is shown at the right side of the page.

Instructions removed by particular architecture release are indicated in the Avail- ability section. There can be more than one assembler format for each architecture level. Floating point operations on formatted data show an assembly format with the actual assembler mnemonic for each valid value of the fmt field. For example, the ADD fmt instruction lists both ADD.S and ADD.D. The assembler format lines sometimes include parenthetical comments to help explain variations in the formats (once again, see C.cond.fmt). These comments are not a part of the assembler format. 2.1.4 Purpose Field The Purpose field gives a short description of the use of the instruction. Figure 2.5 Example of Instruction Purpose 2.1.5 Description Field If a one-line symbolic description of the instruction is feasible, it appears immediately to the right of the Description heading. The main purpose is to show how fields in the instruction are used in the arithmetic or logical operation. Figure 2.6 Example of Instruction Description The body of the section is a description of the operation of the instruction in text, tables, and figures. This description complements the high-level language description in the Operation section. This section uses acronyms for register descriptions. “GPR rt” is CPU general-purpose register specified by the instruction field rt. “FPR fs” is the floating point operand register specified by the instruction field fs. “CP1 register fd” is the coprocessor 1 general register specified by the instruction field fd. “FCSR” is the floating point Control / Status register. 2.1.6 Restrictions Field The Restrictions field documents any possible restrictions that may affect the instruction. Most restrictions fall into one of the following six categories: • V alid values for instruction fields (for example, see floating point ADD.fmt) Purpose: Add Word To add 32-bit integers. If an overflow occurs, then trap. Description: GPR[rd]  GPR[rs] + GPR[rt] The 32-bit word value in GPR rt is added to the 32-bit value in GPR rs to produce a 32-bit result. • If the addition results in 32-bit 2’s complement arithmetic overflow, the destination register is not modified and an Integer Overflow exception occurs. • If the addition does not overflow, the 32-bit result is placed into GPR rd. ","2.1 Understanding the Instruction Fields The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 14 • ALIGNMENT requirements for memory addresses (for example, see LW) • Valid values of operands (for example, see ALNV.PS) • Valid operand formats (for example, see floating point ADD.fmt) • Order of instructions necessary to guarantee correct execution. These ordering constraints avoid pipeline hazards for which some processors do not have hardware interlocks (for example, see MUL). • Valid memory access types (for example, see LL/SC) Figure 2.7 Example of Instruction Restrictions 2.1.7 Availability and Compatibility Fields The Availability and Compatibility sections are not provided for all instructions. These sections list considerations relevant to whether and how an implementation may implement some instructions, when software may use such instructions, and how software can determine if an instruction or feature is present. Such considerations include: • Some instructions are not present on all architecture releases. Sometimes the implementation is required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception, but sometimes executing such an instruction encoding is architec- turally defined to give UNPREDICTABLE results. • Some instructions are available for implementations of a particular architecture release, but may be provided only if an optional feature is implemented. Control register bits typically allow software to determine if the feature is present. • Some instructions may not behave the same way on all implementations. Typically this involves behavior that was UNPREDICTABLE in some implementations, but which is made architectural and guaranteed con- sistent so that software can rely on it in subsequent architecture releases. • Some instructions are prohibited for certain architecture releases and/or optional feature combinations. • Some instructions may be removed for certain architecture releases. Implementations may then be required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception for the removed instruction encoding; but sometimes the instruc- tion encoding is reused for other instructions. All of these considerations may apply to the same instruction. If such considerations applicable to an instruction are simple, the architecture level in which an instruction was defined or redefined in the Format field, and/or the Restric- tions section, may be sufficient; but if the set of such considerations applicable to an instruction is complicated, the Availability and Compatibility sections may be provided. Restrictions: None ","Guide to the Instruction Set 15 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 2.1.8 Operation Field The Operation field describes the operation of the instruction as pseudocode in a high-level language notation resem- bling Pascal. This formal description complements the Description section; it is not complete in itself because many of the restrictions are either difficult to include in the pseudocode or are omitted for legibility. Figure 2.8 Example of Instruction Operation See 2.2 “Operation Section Notation and Functions” on page 16 for more information on the formal notation used here. 2.1.9 Exceptions Field The Exceptions field lists the exceptions that can be caused by Operation of the instruction. It omits exceptions that can be caused by the instruction fetch, for instance, TLB Refill, and also omits exceptions that can be caused by asyn- chronous external events such as an Interrupt. Although a Bus Error exception may be caused by the operation of a load or store instruction, this section does not list Bus Error for load and store instructions because the relationship between load and store instructions and external error indications, like Bus Error, are dependent upon the implemen- tation.

Special symbols used in the pseudocode are described in the previous chapter. Specific pseudocode functions are described below. This section presents information about the following topics: • “Instruction Execution Ordering” on page 16 • “Pseudocode Functions” on page 16 2.2.1 Instruction Execution Ordering Each of the high-level language statements in the Operations section are executed sequentially (except as constrained by conditional and loop constructs). 2.2.2 Pseudocode Functions There are several functions used in the pseudocode descriptions. These are used either to make the pseudocode more readable, to abstract implementation-specific behavior, or both. These functions are defined in this section, and include the following: • “Coprocessor General Register Access Functions” on page 16 • “Memory Operation Functions” on page 18 • “Floating Point Functions” on page 21 • “Miscellaneous Functions” on page 25 2.2.2.1 Coprocessor General Register Access Functions Defined coprocessors, except for CP0, have instructions to exchange words and doublewords between coprocessor general registers and the rest of the system. What a coprocessor does with a word or doubleword supplied to it and how a coprocessor supplies a word or doubleword is defined by the coprocessor itself. This behavior is abstracted into the functions described in this section. 2.2.2.1.1 COP_LW The COP_LW function defines the action taken by coprocessor z when supplied with a word from memory during a load word operation. The action is coprocessor-specific. The typical action would be to store the contents of mem- word in coprocessor general register rt.

For big-endian ordering this is the most-significant byte; for a little-endian ordering this is the least-significant byte. In the Operation pseudocode for load and store operations, the following functions summarize the handling of virtual addresses and the access of physical memory. The size of the data item to be loaded or stored is passed in the Access- Length field. The valid constant names and values are shown in Table 2.1. The bytes within the addressed unit of memory (word for 32-bit processors or doubleword for 64-bit processors) that are used can be determined directly from the AccessLength and the two or three low-order bits of the address. 2.2.2.2.1 Misaligned Support MIPS processors originally required all memory accesses to be naturally aligned. MSA (the MIPS SIMD Architec- ture) supported misaligned memory accesses for its 128 bit packed SIMD vector loads and stores, from its introduc- tion in MIPS Release 5. Release 6 requires systems to provide support for misaligned memory accesses for all ordinary memory reference instructions: the system must provide a mechanism to complete a misaligned memory ref- erence for this instruction, ranging from full execution in hardware to trap-and-emulate. The pseudocode function MisalignedSupport encapsulates the version number check to determine if misalignment is supported for an ordinary memory access. Figure 2.16 MisalignedSupport Pseudocode Function predicate  MisalignedSupport () return Config.AR ≥ 2 // Architecture Revision 2 corresponds to MIPS Release 6. end function See Appendix B, “Misaligned Memory Accesses” on page 511 for a more detailed discussion of misalignment, including pseudocode functions for the actual misaligned memory access. 2.2.2.2.2 AddressTranslation The AddressTranslation function translates a virtual address to a physical address and its cacheability and coherency attribute, describing the mechanism used to resolve the memory reference. ","Guide to the Instruction Set 19 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 Given the virtual address vAddr , and whether the reference is to Instructions or Data (IorD), find the corresponding physical address (pAddr) and the cacheability and coherency attribute (CCA) used to resolve the reference. If the vir- tual address is in one of the unmapped address spaces, the physical address and CCA are determined directly by the virtual address. If the virtual address is in one of the mapped address spaces then the TLB or fixed mapping MMU determines the physical address and access type; if the required translation is not present in the TLB or the desired access is not permitted, the function fails and an exception is taken. Figure 2.17 AddressTranslation Pseudocode Function (pAddr, CCA)  AddressTranslation (vAddr, IorD, LorS) /* pAddr: physical address */ /* CCA: Cacheability&Coherency Attribute,the method used to access caches*/ /* and memory and resolve the reference */ /* vAddr: virtual address */ /* IorD: Indicates whether access is for INSTRUCTION or DATA */ /* LorS: Indicates whether access is for LOAD or STORE */ /* See the address translation description for the appropriate MMU */ /* type in Volume III of this book for the exact translation mechanism */ endfunction AddressTranslation 2.2.2.2.3 LoadMemory The LoadMemory function loads a value from memory. This action uses cache and main memory as specified in both the Cacheability and Coherency Attribute (CCA) and the access (IorD) to find the contents of AccessLength memory bytes, starting at physical location pAddr . The data is returned in a fixed-width naturally aligned memory element (MemElem). The low-order 2 (or 3) bits of the address and the AccessLength indicate which of the bytes within MemElem need to be passed to the processor. If the memory access type of the reference is uncached, only the referenced bytes are read from memory and marked as valid within the memory element. If the access type is cached but the data is not present in cache, an implementation-specific size and alignment block of memory is read and loaded into the cache to satisfy a load reference. At a minimum, this block is the entire memory element.

The specified data is stored into the physical location pAddr using the memory hierarchy (data caches and main mem- ory) as specified by the Cacheability and Coherency Attribute (CCA). The MemElem contains the data for an aligned, fixed-width memory element (a word for 32-bit processors, a doubleword for 64-bit processors), though only the bytes that are actually stored to memory need be valid. The low-order two (or three) bits of pAddr and the AccessLen- gth field indicate which of the bytes within the MemElem data should be stored; only these bytes in memory will actually be changed.

If an FPR contains a value in some format, rather than unformatted contents from a load (uninterpreted), it is valid to interpret the value in that format (but not to interpret it in a different format). 2.2.2.3.1 ValueFPR The ValueFPR function returns a formatted value from the floating point registers.

E.g. sign_extend(immediate16) or sign_extend(disp9). However, sometimes it is necessary to specify the bit position. For example, sign_extend(temp 31..0 ) or the more complicated (offset 15 ) GPRLEN-(16+2) || offset || 0 2 . The explicit notation sign_extend.nbits(val) or sign_extend(val,nbits) is suggested as a simpli- fication. They say to sign extend as if an nbits-sized signed integer. The width to be sign extended to is usually appar- ent by context, and is usually GPRLEN, 32 or 64 bits. The previous examples then become. sign_extend(temp 31..0 ) = sign_extend.32(temp) and (offset 15 ) GPRLEN-(16+2) || offset || 0 2 = sign_extend.16(offset)<<2 Note that sign_extend.N(value) extends from bit position N-1, if the bits are numbered 0..N-1 as is typical. The explicit notations sign_extend.nbits(val) or sign_extend(val,nbits) is used as a simplifica- tion. These notations say to sign extend as if an nbits-sized signed integer. The width to be sign extended to is usually apparent by context, and is usually GPRLEN, 32 or 64 bits. Figure 2.27 sign_extend Pseudocode Functions sign_extend.nbits(val) = sign_extend(val,nbits) /* syntactic equivalents */ function sign_extend(val,nbits) return (val nbits-1 ) GPRLEN-nbits || val nbits-1..0 end function The earlier examples can be expressed as ","Guide to the Instruction Set 25 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 (offset 15 ) GPRLEN-(16+2) || offset || 0 2 = sign_extend.16(offset) << 2) and sign_extend(temp 31..0 ) = sign_extend.32(temp) Similarly for zero_extension, although zero extension is less common than sign extension in the MIPS ISA. Floating point may use notations such as zero_extend.fmt corresponding to the format of the FPU instruction. E.g. zero_extend.S and zero_extend.D are equivalent to zero_extend.32 and zero_extend.64. Existing pseudocode may use any of these, or other, notations. 2.2.2.4.2 memory_address The pseudocode function memory_address performs mode-dependent address space wrapping for compatibility between MIPS32 and MIPS64. It is applied to all memory references. It may be specified explicitly in some places, particularly for new memory reference instructions, but it is also declared to apply implicitly to all memory refer- ences as defined below. In addition, certain instructions that are used to calculate effective memory addresses but which are not themselves memory accesses specify memory_address explicitly in their pseudocode. Figure 2.28 memory_address Pseudocode Function function memory_address(ea) return ea end function On a 32-bit CPU, memory_address returns its 32-bit effective address argument unaffected. In addition to the use of memory_address for all memory references (including load and store instructions, LL/ SC), Release 6 extends this behavior to control transfers (branch and call instructions), and to the PC-relative address calculation instructions (ADDIUPC, AUIPC, ALUIPC). In newer instructions the function is explicit in the pseudo- code. Implicit address space wrapping for all instruction fetches is described by the following pseudocode fragment which should be considered part of instruction fetch: Figure 2.29 Instruction Fetch Implicit memory_address Wrapping PC  memory_address( PC ) ( instruction_data, length )  instruction_fetch( PC ) /* decode and execute instruction */ Implicit address space wrapping for all data memory accesses is described by the following pseudocode, which is inserted at the top of the AddressTranslation pseudocode function: Figure 2.30 AddressTranslation implicit memory_address Wrapping (pAddr, CCA)  AddressTranslation (vAddr, IorD, LorS) vAddr  memory_address(vAddr) In addition to its use in instruction pseudocode, 2.2.2.5 Miscellaneous Functions This section lists miscellaneous functions not covered in previous sections.

The instruction is aborted, inhibiting not only the functional effect of the instruction, but also inhibiting all exceptions detected during fetch, decode, or execution of the instruction in question. For branch-likely instructions, nullification kills the instruction in the delay slot of the branch likely instruction.

When reference is made to these instructions, uppercase mnemonics are used. For instance, in the floating point ADD instruction, op=COP1 and function=ADD. In other cases, a single field has both fixed and variable subfields, so the name con- tains both upper- and lowercase characters. 2.4 FPU Instructions In the detailed description of each FPU instruction, all variable subfields in an instruction format (such as fs, ft, imme- diate, and so on) are shown in lowercase. The instruction name (such as ADD, SUB, and so on) is shown in upper- case. For the sake of clarity, an alias is sometimes used for a variable subfield in the formats of specific instructions. For example, rs=base in the format for load and store instructions. Such an alias is always lowercase since it refers to a variable subfield. Bit encodings for mnemonics are given in Volume I, in the chapters describing the CPU, FPU, MDMX, and MIPS16e instructions. See “Op and Function Subfield Notation” on page 27 for a description of the op and function subfields. ","2.4 FPU Instructions The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 28 ","Chapter 3 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 29 The MIPS32® Instruction Set 3.1 Compliance and Subsetting To be compliant with the MIPS32 Architecture, designs must implement a set of required features, as described in this document set. To allow implementation flexibility, the MIPS32 Architecture provides subsetting rules. An imple- mentation that follows these rules is compliant with the MIPS32 Architecture as long as it adheres strictly to the rules, and fully implements the remaining instructions. Supersetting of the MIPS32 Architecture is only allowed by adding functions to the SPECIAL2, COP2, or both major opcodes, by adding control for co-processors via the COP2, LWC2, SWC2, LDC2, and/or SDC2, or via the addition of approved Application Specific Extensions. Release 6 removes all instructions under the SPECIAL2 major opcode, either by removing them or moving them to the COP2 major opcode. All coprocessor 2 support instructions (for example, LWC2) have been moved to the COP2 major opcode. Supersetting of the Release 6 architecture is only allowed in the COP2 major opcode, or via the addi- tion of approved Application Specific Extensions. SPECIAL2 is reserved for MIPS. Note: The use of COP3 as a customizable coprocessor has been removed in the Release 2 of the MIPS32 architecture. The COP3 is reserved for the future extension of the architecture. Implementations using Release1 of the MIPS32 architecture are strongly discouraged from using the COP3 opcode for a user-available coprocessor as doing so will limit the potential for an upgrade path to a 64-bit floating point unit. The instruction set subsetting rules are described in the subsections below, and also the following rule: • Co-dependence of Architecture Features: MIPSr5™ (also called Release 5) and subsequent releases (such as Release 6) include a number of features. Some are optional; some are required. Features provided by a release, such as MIPSr5 or later, whether optional or required, must be consistent. If any feature that is introduced by a particular release is implemented (such as a feature described as part of Release 5 and not any earlier release) then all other features must be implemented in a manner consistent with that release. For example: the VZ and MSA features are introduced by Release 5 but are optional. The FR=1 64-bit FPU register model was optional when introduced earlier, but is now required by Release 5 if any FPU is implemented. If any or all of VZ or MSA are implemented, then Release 5 is implied, and then if an FPU is implemented, it must implement the FR=1 64- bit FPU register model. 3.1.1 Subsetting of Non-Privileged Architecture • All non-privileged (do not need access to Coprocessor 0) CPU (non-FPU) instructions must be implemented — no subsetting of these are allowed — per the MIPS Instruction Set Architecture release supported. • If any instruction is subsetted out based on the rules below, an attempt to execute that instruction must cause the appropriate exception (typically Reserved Instruction or Coprocessor Unusable). • The FPU and related support instructions, such as CPU conditional branches on FPU conditions (pre-Release 6 BC1T/BC1F, Release 6 BC1NEQZ) and CPU conditional moves on FPU conditions (pre-Release 6 MOVT/ MOVF), may be omitted. Software may determine if an FPU is implemented by checking the state of the FP bit in the Config1 CP0 register. Software may determine which FPU data types are implemented by checking the ","3.1 Compliance and Subsetting The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 30 appropriate bits in the FIR CP1 register. The following allowable FPU subsets are compliant with the MIPS32 architecture: • No FPU Config1.FP=0 • FPU with S, and W formats and all supporting instructions. This 32-bit subset is permitted by Release 6, but prohibited by pre-Release 6 releases. Config1.FP=1, Status.FR=0, FIR.S=FIR.L=1, FIR.D=FIR.L=FIR.PS=0. • FPU with S, D, W, and L formats and all supporting instructions Config1.FP=1, Status.FR=(see below), FIR.S=FIR.L=FIR.D=FIR.L=1, FIR.PS=0. pre-MIPSr5 permits this 64-bit configuration, and allows both FPU register modes. Status.FR=0 support is required but Status.FR=1 support is optional. MIPSr5 permits this 64-bit configuration, and requires both FPU register modes, i.e. both Status.FR=0 and Status.FR=1 support are required. Release 6 permits this 64-bit configuration, but requires Status.FR=1 and FIR.F64=1. Release 6 prohibits Status.FR=0 if FIR.D=1 or FIR.L=1. • FPU with S, D, PS, W, and L formats and all supporting instructions Config1.FP=1, Status.FR=0/1, FIR.S=FIR.L=FIR.D=FIR.L=FIR.PS=1. Release 6 prohibits this mode, and any mode with FIR.PS=1 paired single support. • In Release 5 of the Architecture, if floating point is implemented then FR=1 is required. I.e. the 64-bit FPU, with the FR=1 64-bit FPU register model, is required. The FR=0 32-bit FPU register model continues to be required. • Coprocessor 2 is optional and may be omitted. Software may determine if Coprocessor 2 is implemented by checking the state of the C2 bit in the Config1 CP0 register. If Coprocessor 2 is implemented, the Coprocessor 2 interface instructions (BC2, CFC2, COP2, CTC2, LDC2, LWC2, MFC2, MTC2, SDC2, and SWC2) may be omitted on an instruction-by-instruction basis. • The caches are optional. The Config1 DL and Config1 IL fields denote whether the first level caches are present or not. • Instruction, CP0 Register, and CP1 Control Register fields that are marked “Reserved” or shown as “0” in the description of that field are reserved for future use by the architecture and are not available to implementations. Implementations may only use those fields that are explicitly reserved for implementation dependent use. • Supported Modules/ASEs are optional and may be subsetted out. In most cases, software may determine if a sup- ported Module/ASE is implemented by checking the appropriate bit in the Config1 or Config3 or Config4 CP0 register. If they are implemented, they must implement the entire ISA applicable to the component, or implement subsets that are approved by the Module/ASE specifications. ","The MIPS32® Instruction Set 31 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 • EJTAG is optional and may be subsetted out. If it is implemented, it must implement only those subsets that are approved by the EJTAG specification. If EJTAG is not implemented, the EJTAG instructions (SDBBP and DERET) can be subsetted out. • In MIPS Release 3, there are two architecture branches (MIPS32/64 and microMIPS32/64). A single device is allowed to implement both architecture branches. The Privileged Resource Architecture (COP0) registers do not mode-switch in width (32-bit vs. 64-bit). For this reason, if a device implements both architecture branches, the address/data widths must be consistent. If a device implements MIPS64 and also implements microMIPS, it must implement microMIPS64 not just microMIPS32. Simiarly, If a device implements microMIPS64 and also imple- ments MIPS32/64, it must implement MIPS64 not just MIPS32. • Prior to Release 6, the JALX instruction is required if and only if ISA mode-switching is possible. If both of the architecture branches are implemented (MIPS32/64 and microMIPS32/64) or if MIPS16e is implemented then the JALX instructions are required. If only one branch of the architecture family and MIPS16e is not imple- mented then the JALX instruction is not implemented. The JALX instruction was removed in Release 6. 3.2 Alphabetical List of Instructions The following pages present detailed descriptions of instructions, arranged alphabetical order of opcode mnemonic (except where several similar instructions are described together.) ","ABS.fmt IFloating Point Absolute Value The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 32 Format: ABS.fmt ABS.S fd, fs MIPS32 ABS.D fd, fs MIPS32 ABS.PS fd, fs MIPS64,MIPS32 Release 2, removed in Release 6 Purpose: Floating Point Absolute Value Description: FPR[fd]  abs(FPR[fs]) The absolute value of the value in FPR fs is placed in FPR fd. The operand and result are values in format fmt. ABS.PS takes the absolute value of the two values in FPR fs independently, and ORs together any generated excep- tions. The Cause bits are ORed into the Flag bits if no exception is taken. If FIR Has2008 =0 or FCSR ABS2008 =0 then this operation is arithmetic. For this case, any NaN operand signals invalid operation. If FCSR ABS2008 =1 then this operation is non-arithmetic. For this case, both regular floating point numbers and NAN values are treated alike, only the sign bit is affected by this instruction. No IEEE exception can be generated for this case, and the FCSR Cause and FCSR Flags fields are not modified. Restrictions: The fields fs and fd must specify FPRs valid for operands of type fmt. If the fields are not valid, the result is UNPRE- DICTABLE. The operand must be a value in format fmt; if it is not, the result is UNPREDICTABLE and the value of the operand FPR becomes UNPREDICTABLE. The result of ABS.PS is UNPREDICTABLE if the processor is executing in the FR=0 32-bit FPU register model. ABS.PS is predictable if executing on a 64-bit FPU in the FR=1 mode, but not with FR=0, and not on a 32-bit FPU. Availability and Compatibility: ABS.PS has been removed in Release 6.

Description: FPConditionCode(cc)  FPR[fs] compare_cond FPR[ft] The value in FPR fs is compared to the value in FPR ft; the values are in format fmt. The comparison is exact and nei- ther overflows nor underflows. If the comparison specified by the cond field of the instruction is true for the operand values, the result is true; other- wise, the result is false. If no exception is taken, the result is written into condition code CC; true is 1 and false is 0. In the cond field of the instruction: cond 2..1 specify the nature of the comparison (equals, less than, and so on). cond 0 specifies whether the comparison is ordered or unordered, that is, false or true if any operand is a NaN; cond 3 indi- cates whether the instruction should signal an exception on QNaN inputs, or not (see Table 3.2). C.cond.PS compares the upper and lower halves of FPR fs and FPR ft independently and writes the results into condi- tion codes CC +1 and CC respectively. The CC number must be even. If the number is not even the operation of the instruction is UNPREDICTABLE. If one of the values is an SNaN, or cond 3 is set and at least one of the values is a QNaN, an Invalid Operation condi- tion is raised and the Invalid Operation flag is set in the FCSR. If the Invalid Operation Enable bit is set in the FCSR, no result is written and an Invalid Operation exception is taken immediately. Otherwise, the Boolean result is written into condition code CC. There are four mutually exclusive ordering relations for comparing floating point values; one relation is always true and the others are false. The familiar relations are greater than, less than, and equal. In addition, the IEEE floating point standard defines the relation unordered, which is true when at least one operand value is NaN; NaN compares unordered with everything, including itself. Comparisons ignore the sign of zero, so +0 equals -0. The comparison condition is a logical predicate, or equation, of the ordering relations such as less than or equal, equal, not less than, or unordered or equal. Compare distinguishes among the 16 comparison predicates. The Bool- ean result of the instruction is obtained by substituting the Boolean value of each ordering relation for the two FP val- ues in the equation. If the equal relation is true, for example, then all four example predicates above yield a true result. If the unordered relation is true then only the final predicate, unordered or equal, yields a true result. Logical negation of a compare result allows eight distinct comparisons to test for the 16 predicates as shown in Table 3.2. Each mnemonic tests for both a predicate and its logical negation. For each mnemonic, compare tests the truth of the first predicate. When the first predicate is true, the result is true as shown in the “If Predicate Is True” column, and the second predicate must be false, and vice versa. (Note that the False predicate is never true and False/True do not follow the normal pattern.) The truth of the second predicate is the logical negation of the instruction result. After a compare instruction, test for the truth of the first predicate can be made with the Branch on FP True (BC1T) instruction and the truth of the second 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 11 10 8 7 6 5 4 3 0 COP1 010001 fmt ft fs cc 0 A 0 FC 11 cond 6 5 5 5 3 1 1 2 4 ","C.cond.fmt Floating Point Compare 111 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 can be made with Branch on FP False (BC1F). Table 3.2 shows another set of eight compare operations, distinguished by a cond 3 value of 1 and testing the same 16 conditions. For these additional comparisons, if at least one of the operands is a NaN, including Quiet NaN, then an Invalid Operation condition is raised. If the Invalid Operation condition is enabled in the FCSR, an Invalid Operation exception occurs.

Exceptions: Coprocessor Unusable, Reserved Instruction Floating Point Exceptions: Unimplemented Operation, Invalid Operation Programming Notes: FP computational instructions, including compare, that receive an operand value of Signaling NaN raise the Invalid Operation condition. Comparisons that raise the Invalid Operation condition for Quiet NaNs in addition to SNaNs permit a simpler programming model if NaNs are errors. Using these compares, programs do not need explicit code to check for QNaNs causing the unordered relation. Instead, they take an exception and allow the exception handling system to deal with the error when it occurs.

Description: The 9-bit offset is sign-extended and added to the contents of the base register to form an effective address. The effec- tive address is used in one of the following ways based on the operation to be performed and the type of cache as described in the following table. pre-Release 6 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 0 CACHE 101111 base op offset 6 5 5 16 Release 6 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 7 6 5 0 SPECIAL3 011111 base op offset 0 CACHE 100101 6 5 5 9 1 6 Table 3.3 Usage of Effective Address Operation Requires an Type of Cache Usage of Effective Address Address Virtual The effective address is used to address the cache. An address translation may or may not be performed on the effective address (with the possibility that a TLB Refill or TLB Invalid exception might occur) Address Physical The effective address is translated by the MMU to a physical address. The physical address is then used to address the cache Index N/A The effective address is translated by the MMU to a physical address. It is imple- mentation dependent whether the effective address or the translated physical address is used to index the cache. As such, an unmapped address (such as within kseg0) should always be used for cache operations that require an index. See the Programming Notes section below. Assuming that the total cache size in bytes is CS, the associativity is A, and the number of bytes per tag is BPT, the following calculations give the fields of the address which specify the way and the index: OffsetBit  Log2(BPT) IndexBit  Log2(CS / A) WayBit  IndexBit + Ceiling(Log2(A)) Way  Addr WayBit-1..IndexBit Index  Addr IndexBit-1..OffsetBit For a direct-mapped cache, the Way calculation is ignored and the Index value fully specifies the cache tag. This is shown symbolically in the figure below. ","","CACHE IPerform Cache Operation The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 116 ensure that the writeback data is resident in the outer cache before operating on the outer cache. If neither the CACHE instruction implementation nor the software cache flush sequence follow this policy, then the inclusion property of the caches can be broken, which might be a condition that the cache management hardware cannot properly deal with. When implementing multiple level of caches without the inclusion property, the use of a SYNC instruction after the CACHE instruction is still needed whenever writeback data has to be resident in the next level of memory hierarchy. For multiprocessor implementations that maintain coherent caches, some of the Hit type of CACHE instruction oper- ations may optionally affect all coherent caches within the implementation. If the effective address uses a coherent Cache Coherency Attribute (CCA), then the operation is globalized, meaning it is broadcast to all of the coherent caches within the system. If the effective address does not use one of the coherent CCAs, there is no broadcast of the operation. If multiple levels of caches are to be affected by one CACHE instruction, all of the affected cache levels must be processed in the same manner - either all affected cache levels use the globalized behavior or all affected cache levels use the non-globalized behavior. Table 3.5 Encoding of Bits [20:18] of the CACHE Instruction Code Caches Name Effective Address Operand Type Operation Compliance Implemented 0b000 I Index Invalidate Index Set the state of the cache block at the specified index to invalid. This required encoding may be used by software to invalidate the entire instruction cache by step- ping through all valid indices. Required D Index Writeback Invalidate / Index Invalidate Index For a write-back cache: If the state of the cache block at the specified index is valid and dirty, write the block back to the memory address specified by the cache tag. After that operation is completed, set the state of the cache block to invalid. If the block is valid but not dirty, set the state of the block to invalid. For a write-through cache: Set the state of the cache block at the specified index to invalid. This required encoding may be used by software to invalidate the entire data cache by stepping through all valid indices. The Index Store Tag must be used to initialize the cache at power up. Required S, T Index Writeback Invalidate / Index Invalidate Index Required if S, T cache is implemented 0b001 All Index Load Tag Index Read the tag for the cache block at the specified index into the TagLo and TagHi Coprocessor 0 registers.

Clearing the lock state via Index Store Tag is dependent on the implementation-dependent cache tag and cache line organization, and that Index and Index Writeback Invalidate opera- tions are dependent on cache line organization. Only Hit and Hit Writeback Invalidate opera- tions are generally portable across implementa- tions. It is implementation dependent whether a locked line is displaced as the result of an external invalidate or intervention that hits on the locked line. Software must not depend on the locked line remaining in the cache if an external invali- date or intervention would invalidate the line if it were not locked.

TLB Invalid Exception Coprocessor Unusable Exception Address Error Exception Cache Error Exception Bus Error Exception Programming Notes: Release 6 architecture implements a 9-bit offset, whereas all release levels lower than Release 6 implement a 16-bit offset. For cache operations that require an index, it is implementation dependent whether the effective address or the trans- lated physical address is used as the cache index. Therefore, the index value should always be converted to an unmapped address (such as an kseg0 address - by ORing the index with 0x80000000 before being used by the cache instruction). For example, the following code sequence performs a data cache Index Store Tag operation using the index passed in GPR a0: li a1, 0x80000000 /* Base of kseg0 segment */ or a0, a0, a1 /* Convert index to kseg0 address */ cache DCIndexStTag, 0(a1) /* Perform the index store tag operation */ ","CACHE IPerform Cache Operation The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 120 ","","CACHEE IPerform Cache Operation EVA The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 122 operations (where the address is used to index the cache but need not match the cache tag) software should use unmapped addresses to avoid TLB exceptions. This instruction never causes TLB Modified exceptions nor TLB Refill exceptions with a cause code of TLBS. This instruction never causes Execute-Inhibit nor Read-Inhibit excep- tions. The effective address may be an arbitrarily-aligned by address. The CACHEE instruction never causes an Address Error Exception due to an non-aligned address. A Cache Error exception may occur as a by-product of some operations performed by this instruction. For example, if a Writeback operation detects a cache or bus error during the processing of the operation, that error is reported via a Cache Error exception. Similarly, a Bus Error Exception may occur if a bus operation invoked by this instruction is terminated in an error. However, cache error exceptions must not be triggered by an Index Load Tag or Index Store tag operation, as these operations are used for initialization and diagnostic purposes. An Address Error Exception (with cause code equal AdEL) may occur if the effective address references a portion of the kernel address space which would normally result in such an exception. It is implementation dependent whether such an exception does occur. It is implementation dependent whether a data watch is triggered by a cache instruction whose address matches the Watch register address match conditions. The CACHEE instruction and the memory transactions which are sourced by the CACHEE instruction, such as cache refill or cache writeback, obey the ordering and completion rules of the SYNC instruction. Bits [17:16] of the instruction specify the cache on which to perform the operation, as follows: Bits [20:18] of the instruction specify the operation to perform. To provide software with a consistent base of cache operations, certain encodings must be supported on all processors. The remaining encodings are recommended When implementing multiple level of caches and where the hardware maintains the smaller cache as a proper subset of a larger cache, it is recommended that the CACHEE instructions must first operate on the smaller, inner-level cache. For example, a Hit_Writeback _Invalidate operation targeting the Secondary cache, must first operate on the primary data cache first. If the CACHEE instruction implementation does not follow this policy then any software which flushes the caches must mimic this behavior. That is, the software sequences must first operate on the inner cache then operate on the outer cache. The software must place a SYNC instruction after the CACHEE instruction whenever there are possible writebacks from the inner cache to ensure that the writeback data is resident in the outer cache before operating on the outer cache. If neither the CACHEE instruction implementation nor the software cache flush sequence follow this policy, then the inclusion property of the caches can be broken, which might be a condition that the cache management hardware cannot properly deal with. When implementing multiple level of caches without the inclusion property, you must use SYNC instruction after the CACHEE instruction whenever writeback data has to be resident in the next level of memory hierarchy. For multiprocessor implementations that maintain coherent caches, some of the Hit type of CACHEE instruction operations may optionally affect all coherent caches within the implementation. If the effective address uses a coher- ent Cache Coherency Attribute (CCA), then the operation is globalized, meaning it is broadcast to all of the coherent Table 3.7 Encoding of Bits[17:16] of CACHEE Instruction Code Name Cache 0b00 I Primary Instruction 0b01 D Primary Data or Unified Primary 0b10 T Tertiary 0b11 S Secondary ","CACHEE Perform Cache Operation EVA 123 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 caches within the system. If the effective address does not use one of the coherent CCAs, there is no broadcast of the operation. If multiple levels of caches are to be affected by one CACHEE instruction, all of the affected cache levels must be processed in the same manner — either all affected cache levels use the globalized behavior or all affected cache levels use the non-globalized behavior. The CACHEE instruction functions the same as the CACHE instruction, except that address translation is performed using the user mode virtual address space mapping in the TLB when accessing an address within a memory segment configured to use the MUSUK access mode. Memory segments using UUSK or MUSK access modes are also acces- sible . Refer to Volume III, Enhanced Virtual Addressing section for additional information.

Description: GPR[rt]  FP_Control[fs] Copy the 32-bit word from FP (coprocessor 1) control register fs into GPR rt. The definition of this instruction has been extended in Release 5 to support user mode read and write of Status FR under the control of Config5 UFR . This optional feature is meant to facilitate transition from FR=0 to FR=1 float- ing-point register modes in order to obsolete FR=0 mode in a future architecture release. User code may set and clear Status FR without kernel intervention, providing kernel explicitly provides permission. This UFR facility is not supported in Release 6 because Release 6 only allows FR=1 mode. Accessing the UFR and UNFR registers causes a Reserved Instruction exception in Release 6 because FIR UFRP is always 0. The definition of this instruction has been extended in Release 6 to allow user code to read and modify the Config5 FRE bit. Such modification is allowed when this bit is present (as indicated by FIR UFRP ) and user mode modification of the bit is enabled by the kernel (as indicated by Config5 UFE ). Setting Config5 FRE to 1 causes all floating point instructions which are not compatible with FR=1 mode to take an Reserved Instruction exception. This makes it possible to run pre-Release 6 FR=0 floating point code on a Release 6 core which only supports FR=1 mode, provided the kernel has been set up to trap and emulate FR=0 behavior for these instructions. These instructions include floating-point arithmetic instructions that read/write single-precision registers, LWC1, SWC1, MTC1, and MFC1 instructions. The FRE facility uses COP1 register aliases FRE and NFRE to access Config5 FRE . Restrictions: There are a few control registers defined for the floating point unit. Prior to Release 6, the result is UNPREDICT- ABLE if fs specifies a register that does not exist. In Release 6 and later, a Reserved Instruction exception occurs if fs specifies a register that does not exist. The result is UNPREDICTABLE if fs specifies the UNFR or NFRE write-only control.

The comparison is exact and neither overflows nor underflows. If the comparison specified by the condn field of the instruction is true for the operand values, the result is true; other- wise, the result is false. If no exception is taken, the result is written into FPR fd; true is all 1s and false is all 0s, repeated the operand width of fmt. All other bits beyond the operand width fmt are UNPREDICTABLE. For example, a 32-bit single precision comparison writes a mask of 32 0s or 1s into bits 0 to 31 of FPR fd. It makes bits 32 to 63 UNPREDICTABLE if a 64-bit FPU without MSA is present. It makes bits 32 to 127 UNPREDICTABLE if MSA is present. The values are in format fmt. These instructions, however, do not use an fmt field to determine the data type. The condn field of the instruction specifies the nature of the comparison: equals, less than, and so on, unordered or ordered, signalling or quiet, as specified in Table 3.9 “Comparing CMP.condn.fmt, IEEE 754-2008, C.cond.fmt, and MSA FP compares” on page 138. Release 6: The condn field bits have specific purposes: cond 4 , and cond 2..1 specify the nature of the comparison (equals, less than, and so on); cond 0 specifies whether the comparison is ordered or unordered, that is false or true if any operand is a NaN; cond 3 indicates whether the instruction should signal an exception on QNaN inputs. However, in the future the MIPS ISA may be extended in ways that do not preserve these meanings. All encodings of the condn field that are not specified (for example, items shaded in Table 3.9) are reserved in Release 6 and produce a Reserved Instruction exception. If one of the values is an SNaN, or if a signalling comparison is specified and at least one of the values is a QNaN, an Invalid Operation condition is raised and the Invalid Operation flag is set in the FCSR. If the Invalid Operation Enable bit is set in the FCSR, no result is written and an Invalid Operation exception is taken immediately. Otherwise, the mask result is written into FPR fd. There are four mutually exclusive ordering relations for comparing floating point values; one relation is always true and the others are false. The familiar relations are greater than, less than, and equal. In addition, the IEEE floating point standard defines the relation unordered, which is true when at least one operand value is NaN; NaN compares unordered with everything, including itself. Comparisons ignore the sign of zero, so +0 equals -0. The comparison condition is a logical predicate, or equation, of the ordering relations such as less than or equal, equal, not less than, or unordered or equal. Compare distinguishes among the 16 comparison predicates. The Bool- ean result of the instruction is obtained by substituting the Boolean value of each ordering relation for the two FP val- ues in the equation. For example: If the equal relation is true, then all four example predicates above yield a true result. If the unordered relation is true then only the final predicate, unordered or equal, yields a true result. 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 11 10 6 5 4 0 COP1 010001 CMP.condn.S 10100 ft fs fd 0 condn COP1 010001 CMP.condn.D 10101 ft fs fd 0 condn 6 5 5 5 5 1 5 ","CMP.condn.fmt IFloating Point Compare Setting Mask The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 137 The predicates implemented are described in Table 3.9 “Comparing CMP.condn fmt, IEEE 754-2008, C.cond.fmt, and MSA FP compares” on page 138. Not all of the 16 IEEE predicates are implemented directly by hardware. For the directed comparisons (LT, LE, GT, GE) the missing predicates can be obtained by reversing the FPR register operands ft and fs. For example, the hardware implements the “Ordered Less Than” predicate LT(fs,ft); reversing the operands LT(ft,fs) produces the dual predicate “Unordered or Greater Than or Equal” UGE(fs,ft). Table 3.9 shows these mappings. Reversing inputs is ineffective for the symmetric predicates such as EQ; Release 6 implements these negative predicates directly, so that all mask values can be generated in a single instruction. Table 3.9 compares CMP.condn.fmt to (1) the MIPS32 Pre-Release 6 C.cond.fmt instructions, and (2) the (MSA) MIPS SIMD Architecture packed vector floating point comparison instructions. CMP.condn fmt provides exactly the same comparisons for FPU scalar values that MSA provides for packed vectors, with similar mnemonics.

The new 32-bit CRC value is generated with a cumulative 32-bit CRC value input as GPR[rt] and a byte or half-word or word message right-justified in GPR[rs]. The message size is encoded in field sz of the instruc- tion. The generated value overwrites the input CRC value in GPR[rt], as the original value is considered redundant once the cumulative CRC value is re-generated with the additional message. More importantly, source-destroying defini- tion of the CRC instruction allows the instruction to be included in a loop without having to move the destination to the source for the next iteration of the instruction. The CRC32B/H/W instruction does not pad the input message. It is software’s responsibility to ensure the input mes- sage, whether byte, half-word, word or double-word is fully-defined, otherwise the result is UNPREDICTABLE and thus unusable. The reversed polynomial is a 33-bit polynomial of degree 32. Since the coefficient of most significance is always 1, it is dropped from the 32-bit binary number, as per standard representation. The order of the remaining coefficients increases from right to left in the binary representation. Since the CRC is processed more than a bit at a time, the order of bits in the data elements of size byte, half-word, word or double-word is important. The specification assumes support for an “lsb-first” (little-endian) standard, and thus coefficients of polynomial terms that represent the message must be ordered from right to left in order of dec- creasing significance. The specification of the CRC instruction assumes the following in regards to a message of arbitrary length whose 32- bit CRC value is to be generated. The message itself is a polynomial represented by binary coefficients of each term of the polynomial. • The message is a sequence of bytes or half-words or words as per use case. The appropriate instruction is chosen. • For each message element of size byte/half-word/word/double-word, the least-significant bit corresponds to the most significant coefficient, and significance decreases from right to left. • Message elements themselves must be processed in order of decreasing significance, with reference to coeffi- cients of the terms of the polynomial the message represents. • The polynomial is thus reversed to match the order of coefficients for the message of arbitrary length. • The resultant CRC is also a polynomial whose coefficients are arranged in decreasing significance from right to left. 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 11 10 6 5 0 SPECIAL3 011111 rs rt 00000 000 sz CRC 001111 6 5 5 5 3 2 6 ","CRC32B, CRC32H, CRC32W IGenerate CRC with reversed polynomial 0xEDB88320 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 144 The typical use of CRC is to generate a checksum to accompany a message that is transmitted electronically in order to detect transmission errors at the receiving end.

However BITSWAP would only apply to byte messages. CRC32B/H/Winstructions are interchangeable: a series of low-order CRC instructions can be reduced to a series of high-order CRC32H operations, to increase throughput of the overall CRC generation process. The process of doing this will add trailing zeroes to the message for which CRC is being generated, since the data element is now larger, however, this will not change the CRC value that is generated. It is the original message that must be transmitted along with the CRC, without the trailing zeroes.

The simple example assumes some multiple of 4 bytes are processed. for (i=0; i < byte_cnt/4 ; i++) lw $2, 0($4) // read message words crc32cw $3, $2, $3 add $4, $4, 4 // increment word memory address by 4 endfor The throughput is thus increased by a multiple of 4 as only a quarter of the byte oriented operations occur. ","CTC1 IMove Control Word to Floating Point The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 149 Format: CTC1 rt, fs MIPS32 Purpose: Move Control Word to Floating Point To copy a word from a GPR to an FPU control register. Description: FP_Control[fs]  GPR[rt] Copy the low word from GPR rt into the FP (coprocessor 1) control register indicated by fs. Writing to the floating point Control/Status register, the FCSR, causes the appropriate exception if any Cause bit and its corresponding Enable bit are both set. The register is written before the exception occurs. Writing to FEXR to set a cause bit whose enable bit is already set, or writing to FENR to set an enable bit whose cause bit is already set causes the appropriate exception. The register is written before the exception occurs and the EPC register contains the address of the CTC1 instruction. The definition of this instruction has been extended in Release 5 to support user mode read and write of Status FR under the control of Config5 UFR . This optional feature is meant to facilitate transition from FR=0 to FR=1 float- ing-point register modes in order to obsolete FR=0 mode in a future architecture release. User code may set and clear Status FR without kernel intervention, providing kernel explicitly provides permission. This UFR facility is not supported in Release 6 since Release 6 only allows FR=1 mode. Accessing the UFR and UNFR registers causes a Reserved Instruction exception in Release 6 since FIR UFRP is always 0. The definition of this instruction has been extended in Release 6 to allow user code to read and modify the Config5 FRE bit. Such modification is allowed when this bit is present (as indicated by FIR UFRP ) and user mode modification of the bit is enabled by the kernel (as indicated by Config5 UFE ). Setting Config5 FRE to 1 causes all floating point instructions which are not compatible with FR=1 mode to take an Reserved Instruction exception. This makes it possible to run pre-Release 6 FR=0 floating point code on a Release 6 core which only supports FR=1 mode, provided the kernel has been set up to trap and emulate FR=0 behavior for these instructions. These instructions include floating-point arithmetic instructions that read/write single-precision registers, LWC1, SWC1, MTC1, and MFC1 instructions. The FRE facility uses COP1 register aliases FRE and NFRE to access Config5 FRE . Restrictions: There are a few control registers defined for the floating point unit. Prior to Release 6, the result is UNPREDICT- ABLE if fs specifies a register that does not exist. In Release 6 and later, a Reserved Instruction exception occurs if fs specifies a register that does not exist. Furthermore, the result is UNPREDICTABLE if fd specifies the UFR, UNFR, FRE and NFRE aliases, with fs any- thing other than 00000, GPR[0]. Release 6 implementations and later are required to produce a Reserved Instruction exception; software must assume it is UNPREDICTABLE.

Description: DERET clears execution and instruction hazards, returns from Debug Mode and resumes non-debug execution at the instruction whose address is contained in the DEPC register. DERET does not execute the next instruction (i.e. it has no delay slot). Restrictions: A DERET placed between an LL and SC instruction does not cause the SC to fail. If the DEPC register with the return address for the DERET was modified by an MTC0 or a DMTC0 instruction, a CP0 hazard exists that must be removed via software insertion of the appropriate number of SSNOP instructions (for implementations of Release 1 of the Architecture) or by an EHB, or other execution hazard clearing instruction (for implementations of Release 2 of the Architecture). DERET implements a software barrier that resolves all execution and instruction hazards created by Coprocessor 0 state changes (for Release 2 implementations, refer to the SYNCI instruction for additional information on resolving instruction hazards created by writing the instruction stream). The effects of this barrier are seen starting with the instruction fetch and decode of the instruction at the PC to which the DERET returns. This instruction is legal only if the processor is executing in Debug Mode. Pre-Release 6: The operation of the processor is UNDEFINED if a DERET is executed in the delay slot of a branch or jump instruction.

If divide-by-zero or overflow conditions are detected and some action taken, then the divide instruction is followed by additional instructions to check for a zero divisor and/or for overflow. If the divide is asynchronous then the zero-divisor check can execute in parallel with the divide. The action taken on either divide-by-zero or overflow is either a convention within the program itself, or within the sys- tem software. A possibility is to take a BREAK exception with a code field value to signal the problem to the system software. As an example, the C programming language in a UNIX® environment expects division by zero to either terminate the program or execute a program-specified signal handler. C does not expect overflow to cause any exceptional con- dition. If the C compiler uses a divide instruction, it also emits code to test for a zero divisor and execute a BREAK instruction to inform the operating system if a zero is detected. By default, most compilers for the MIPS architecture emits additional instructions to check for the divide-by-zero and overflow cases when this instruction is used. In many compilers, the assembler mnemonic “DIV r0, rs, rt” can be used to prevent these additional test instructions to be emitted. In some processors the integer divide operation may proceed asynchronously and allow other CPU instructions to execute before it is complete.

For each of the div/mod operator pairs DIV/M OD, DIVU/MODU, the results satisfy the equation (A div B)*B + (A mod B) = A, where (A mod B) has same sign as the dividend A, and abs(A mod B) < abs(B). This equation uniquely defines the results. NOTE: if the divisor B=0, this equation cannot be satisfied, and the result is UNPREDICTABLE. This is commonly called “truncated division”. DIV performs a signed 32-bit integer division, and places the 32-bit quotient result in the destination register. MOD performs a signed 32-bit integer division, and places the 32-bit remainder result in the destination register. The remainder result has the same sign as the dividend.

Release 6 divide instructions have the same opcode mnemonic as the pre-Release 6 divide instructions (DIV, DIVU). The instruction encodings are different, as are the instruction semantics: the Release 6 instruction produces only the quotient, whereas the pre-Release 6 instruction produces quotient and remainder in HI/LO registers respectively, and separate modulo instructions are required to obtain the remainder. The assembly syntax distinguishes the Release 6 from the pre-Release 6 divide instructions. For example, Release 6 “DIV rd,rs,rt” specifies 3 register operands, versus pre-Release 6 “DIV rs,rt”, which has only two register arguments, with the HI/LO registers implied. Some assemblers accept the pseudo-instruction syntax “DIV rd,rs,rt” and expand it to do “DIV rs,rt;MFHI rd”. Phrases such as “DIV with GPR output” and “DIV with HI/LO output” may be used when disambiguation is necessary. Pre-Release 6 divide instructions that produce quotient and remainder in the HI/LO registers produce a Reserved Instruction exception on Release 6. In the future, the instruction encoding may be reused for other instructions. Programming Notes: Because the divide and modulo instructions are defined to not trap if dividing by zero, it is safe to emit code that checks for zero-divide after the divide or modulo instruction.

Description: GPR[rt]  VPControl ; VPControl DIS  1 Disabling a virtual processor means that instruction fetch is terminated, and all outstanding instructions for the affected virtual processor(s) must be complete before the DVP itself is allowed to retire. Any outstanding events such as hardware instruction or data prefetch, or page-table walks must also be terminated. The DVP instruction has implicit SYNC(stype=0) semantics but with respect to the other virtual processors in the physical core. After all other virtual processors have been disabled, VPControl DIS is set. Prior to modification and if rt is non- zero, VPControl is written to GPR[rt].If DVP is specified without rt, then rtmust be 0. DVP may also take effect on a virtual processor that has executed a WAIT or a PAUSE instruction. If a virtual proces- sor has executed a WAIT instruction, then it cannot resume execution on an interrupt until an EVP has been executed. If the EVP is executed before the interrupt arrives, then the virtual processor resumes in a state as if the DVP had not been executed, that is, it waits for the interrupt. If a virtual processor has executed a PAUSE instruction, then it cannot resume execution until an EVP has been exe- cuted, even if LLbit is cleared. If an EVP is executed before the LLbit is cleared, then the virtual processor resumes in a state as if the DVP has not been executed, that is, it waits for the LLbit to clear. The execution of a DVP must be followed by the execution of an EVP. The execution of an EVP causes execution to resume immediately—where applicable—on all other virtual processors, as if the DVP had not been executed. The execution is completely restorable after the EVP. If an event occurs in between the DVP and EVP that renders state of the virtual processor UNPREDICTABLE (such as power-gating), then the effect of EVP is UNPREDICTABLE. DVP may only take effect if VPControl DIS =0. Otherwise it is treated as a NOP instruction. If a virtual processor is disabled due to a DVP, then interrupts are also disabled for the virtual processor, that is, logi- cally Status IE =0. Status IE for the target virtual processors though is not cleared though as software cannot access state on the virtual processors that have been disabled. Similarly, deferred exceptions will not cause a disabled virtual processor to be re-enabled for execution, at least until execution is re-enabled by the EVP instruction. The vir- tual processor that executes the DVP, however, continues to be interruptible. In an implementation, the ability of a virtual processor to execute instructions may also be under control external to the physical core which contains the virtual processor. If disabled by DVP, a virtual processor must not resume fetch in response to the assertion of this external signal to enable fetch. Conversely, if fetch is disabled by such external control, then execution of EVP will not cause fetch to resume at a target virtual processor for which the control is deasserted. This instruction never executes speculatively. It must be the oldest unretired instruction to take effect. This instruction is only available in Release 6 implementations. For implementations that do not support multi- threading (Config5 VP =0), this instruction must be treated as a NOP instruction.

Kernel software may also be in a critical region, or in a high-priority interrupt handler when the disable occurs. Since the instruction is itself privileged, such events are considered acceptable. Before executing an EVP in a DVP/EVP pair, software should first read VPControl DIS , returned by DVP, to deter- mine whether the virtual processors are already disabled. If so, the DVP/EVP sequence should be abandoned. This step allows software to safely nest DVP/EVP pairs. Privileged software may use DVP/EVP to disable virtual processors on a core, such as for the purpose of doing a cache flush without interference from other processes in a system with multiple virtual processors or physical cores. DVP (and EVP) may be used in other cases such as for power-savings or changing state that is applicable to all virtual processors in a core, such as virtual processor scheduling priority, as described below: ll t0 0(a0) dvp // disable all other virtual processors pause // wait for LLbit to clear evp // enable all othe virtual processors ","DVP IDisable Virtual Processor The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 174 ll t0 0(a0) dvp // disable all other virtual processors <change core-wide state> evp // enable all othe virtual processors ","EHB Execution Hazard Barrier 175 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 Format: EHB Assembly Idiom MIPS32 Release 2 Purpose: Execution Hazard Barrier To stop instruction execution until all execution hazards have been cleared. Description: EHB is used to denote execution hazard barrier. The actual instruction is interpreted by the hardware as SLL r0, r0, 3. This instruction alters the instruction issue behavior on a pipelined processor by stopping execution until all execu- tion hazards have been cleared. Other than those that might be created as a consequence of setting Status CU0 , there are no execution hazards visible to an unprivileged program running in User Mode. All execution hazards created by previous instructions are cleared for instructions executed immediately following the EHB, even if the EHB is exe- cuted in the delay slot of a branch or jump. The EHB instruction does not clear instruction hazards—such hazards are cleared by the JALR.HB, JR.HB, and ERET instructions. Restrictions: None Operation: ClearExecutionHazards() Exceptions: None Programming Notes: In Release 2 implementations, this instruction resolves all execution hazards. On a superscalar processor, EHB alters the instruction issue behavior in a manner identical to SSNOP. For backward compatibility with Release 1 implemen- tations, the last of a sequence of SSNOPs can be replaced by an EHB. In Release 1 implementations, the EHB will be treated as an SSNOP, thereby preserving the semantics of the sequence. In Release 2 implementations, replacing the final SSNOP with an EHB should have no performance effect because a properly sized sequence of SSNOPs will have already cleared the hazard. As EHB becomes the standard in MIPS implementations, the previous SSNOPs can be removed, leaving only the EHB. 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 11 10 6 5 0 SPECIAL 000000 0 00000 0 00000 0 00000 3 00011 SLL 000000 6 5 5 5 5 6 ","EI IEnable Interrupts The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 176 Format: EI MIPS32 Release 2 EI rt MIPS32 Release 2 Purpose: Enable Interrupts To return the previous value of the Status register and enable interrupts.

Unlike the multiple instruction sequence, however, the EI instruction cannot be aborted in the middle by an interrupt or exception. This instruction creates an execution hazard between the change to the Status register and the point where the change to the interrupt enable takes effect. This hazard is cleared by the EHB, JALR.HB, JR.HB, or ERET instructions. Soft- ware must not assume that a fixed latency will clear the execution hazard. 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 11 10 6 5 4 3 2 0 COP0 0100 00 MFMC0 01 011 rt 12 0110 0 0 000 00 sc 1 0 0 0 0 000 6 5 5 5 5 1 2 3 ","ERET IException Return The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 177 Format: ERET MIPS32 Purpose: Exception Return To return from interrupt, exception, or error trap. Description: ERET clears execution and instruction hazards, conditionally restores SRSCtl CSS from SRSCtl PSS in a Release 2 implementation, and returns to the interrupted instruction at the completion of interrupt, exception, or error process- ing. ERET does not execute the next instruction (that is, it has no delay slot). Restrictions: Pre-Release 6: The operation of the processor is UNDEFINED if an ERET is executed in the delay slot of a branch or jump instruction. Release 6: Implementations are required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception if ERET is encountered in the delay slot or forbidden slot of a branch or jump instruction. An ERET placed between an LL and SC instruction will always cause the SC to fail. ERET implements a software barrier that resolves all execution and instruction hazards created by Coprocessor 0 state changes (for Release 2 implementations, refer to the SYNCI instruction for additional information on resolving instruction hazards created by writing the instruction stream). The effects of this barrier are seen starting with the instruction fetch and decode of the instruction at the PC to which the ERET returns. In a Release 2 implementation, ERET does not restore SRSCtl CSS from SRSCtl PSS if Status BEV = 1, or if Status ERL = 1 because any exception that sets Status ERL to 1 (Reset, Soft Reset, NMI, or cache error) does not save SRSCtl CSS in SRSCtl PSS .

Description: ERETNC clears execution and instruction hazards, conditionally restores SRSCtl CSS from SRSCtl PSS when imple- mented, and returns to the interrupted instruction at the completion of interrupt, exception, or error processing. ERETNC does not execute the next instruction (i.e., it has no delay slot). ERETNC is identical to ERET except that an ERETNC will not clear the LLbit that is set by execution of an LL instruction, and thus when placed between an LL and SC sequence, will never cause the SC to fail. An ERET must continue to be used by default in interrupt and exception processing handlers. The handler may have accessed a synchronizable block of memory common to code that is atomically accessing the memory, and where the code caused the exception or was interrupted. Similarly, a process context-swap must also continue to use an ERET in order to avoid a possible false success on execution of SC in the restored context. Multiprocessor systems with non-coherent cores (i.e., without hardware coherence snooping) should also continue to use ERET, because it is the responsibility of software to maintain data coherence in the system. An ERETNC is useful in cases where interrupt/exception handlers and kernel code involved in a process context- swap can guarantee no interference in accessing synchronizable memory across different contexts. ERETNC can also be used in an OS-level debugger to single-step through code for debug purposes, avoiding the false clearing of the LLbit and thus failure of an LL and SC sequence in single-stepped code. Software can detect the presence of ERETNC by reading Config5 LLB . Restrictions: Release 6 implementations are required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception if ERETNC is executed in the delay slot or Release 6 forbidden slot of a branch or jump instruction. ERETNC implements a software barrier that resolves all execution and instruction hazards created by Coprocessor 0 state changes. (For Release 2 implementations, refer to the SYNCI instruction for additional information on resolving instruction hazards created by writing the instruction stream.)

All rights reserved. Format: GINVI rs MIPS32 Release 6 Purpose: Global Invalidate Instruction Cache In a multi-processor system, fully invalidate all remote primary instruction-caches, or a specified single cache. The local primary instruction cache is also fully invalidated in the case where all the remote caches are to be invalidated. Description: Invalidate_All_Primary_Instruction_Caches(null or rs) Fully invalidate all remote primary instruction caches, or a specified single cache, whether local or remote. The local primary instruction cache is also fully invalidated in the case where all remote caches are to be invalidated. If rs field of the opcode is 0, then all caches are to be invalidated. ‘rs’ should be specified as 0 in the assembly syntax for this case. If rs field of the opcode is not 0, then a single cache that is specified by an implementation dependent number of lower bits of GPR[rs] is invalidated, which may be the local cache itself. Software based invalidation of the primary instruction cache is required in a system if coherency of the cache is not maintained in hardware. While typically limited to the primary cache, the scope of the invalidation within a processor is however implementation dependent - it should apply to all instruction caches within the cache hierarchy that required software coherence maintenance. In legacy systems, it is software’s responsibility to keep the instruction cache state consistent through SYNCI instruc- tions. This instruction provides a method for bulk invalidating the instruction caches in lieu of SYNCI. The instruction’s action is considered complete when the both the local and remote cache invalidations are complete, that is, the data in the cache is no longer available to the related instruction stream. Whether these invalidations are complete can only be determined by the completion of a SYNC (stype=0x14) that follows the invalidate instruc- tion(s). With the completion of the SYNC operation, all global invalidations preceding the SYNC in the program are considered globally visible. Whether the SYNC(stype=0x14) or the global invalidate itself cause synchronization of the instruction stream to new state/context is implementation dependent. A processor may send a global invalidate instruction remotely only when any preceding global invalidate for the pro- gram has reached a global ordering point. The GINVI has no instruction or execution hazard barrier semantics in itself. If the implementation allows a cache line to be locked, i.e., not replaceable during a fill, GINVI will not invalidate the line. A cache line can be locked through the optional CACHE “Fetch and Lock” instruction. See Programming Notes for programming constraints. Restrictions: If an implementation does not support the instruction, a Reserved Instruction exception is caused. If access to Coprocessor 0 is not enabled, a Coprocessor Unusable Exception is signaled. In a single processor SOC, this instruction acts on the local instruction cache only.

","GINVT IGlobal Invalidate TLB The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 189 Copyright © 2016 MIPS Technologies Inc. All rights reserved. Format: GINVT rs, type MIPS32 Release 6 Purpose: Global Invalidate TLB In a multi-processor system, invalidate translations of remote TLBs and local TLB. Description: Invalidate_TLB(GPR[rs], MemoryMapID) Invalidate a TLB in multiple ways - entire TLB, by Virtual Address and MemoryMapID, by MemoryMapID or Vir- tual Address. The Virtual Address is obtained from GPR[rs]. The MemoryMapID is derived from CP0 MemoryMapID. The virtual address is associated with a specific Memory Map identified by MemoryMapID. The virtual address within GPR[rs] is aligned to twice the size of the minimum page size of 4KB i.e., it is equivalent to EntryHi VPN2 : bit 13 of the virtual address is aligned to bit 13 of GPR[rs]. If the virtual address is not required, such as in the case of invalidate All or by MemoryMapID, then ‘rs’ should be specified as 0 in the assembly syntax but is otherwise ignored. The MemoryMapID is a replacement for EntryHi ASID . The MemoryMapID is an implementation-dependent num- ber of bits that must be larger than the existing EntryHi ASID (10-bits including EntryHi ASIDX ). The purpose of a larger tag is to be able to uniquely identify processes in the system. A 16-bit MemoryMapID for example will iden- tify 64K Memory Maps, while the current 8-bit ASID only identifies 256, and is thus subject to frequent recycling. An implementation with MemoryMapID is designed to be backward compatible with software that uses EntryHi A- SID . See CP0 MemoryMapID. Table 3.1 specifies the different types of invalidates supported as a function of the “type” field of the instruction. With reference to Table 3.1, if the Global bit in a TLB entry is set, then MemoryMapID comparison is ignored by the operation. The instruction is considered complete when the local and remote invalidations are complete. Whether these invalida- tions are complete can only be determined by the completion of a SYNC (stype=0x14) that follows the invalidate instruction(s). With the completion of the SYNC operation, all invalidations of this type preceding the SYNC in the program are considered globally visible. Whether the SYNC(stype=0x14) or the global invalidate itself cause synchronization of the instruction stream to new state/context is implementation dependent. A GINVT based invalidation is complete, whether local or remote, when the following has occurred: the TLB is invalidated of matching entries, and all instructions in the instruction stream after the point of completion can only access the new context. 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 10 9 8 7 6 5 0 SPECIAL3 011111 rs 00000 000000 type GINVT 10 GINV 111101 6 5 5 6 2 2 6 Table 3.1 Types of Global TLB Invalidates Encoding of “type” field Definition 00 Invalidate entire TLB 01 Invalidate by VA (MemoryMapID is globalized) 10 Invalidate by MemoryMapID 11 Invalidate by VA and MemoryMapID.

A processor may send a global invalidate instruction remotely only when any preceding global invalidate for the pro- gram has reached a global ordering point.

Between the save and restore, it must utilize unmapped addresses. An MTC0 that modifies MemoryMapID must be followed by an EHB to make this value visible to a subsequent GINVT. Where multiple GINVTs are used prior to a single SYNC (stype=0x14), each may use a different value of MemoryMapID. For the local processor, the instruction stream is synchronized to the new translation context (where applicable) by an instruction hazard barrier such as JR.HB. The instruction stream in the remote processor is synchronized with respect to the execution of GINVT once the SYNC operation completes. The following sequence is recommended for use of GINVT. mtc0 0, C0_PWCtl /* disable Page Walker,where applicable;implementation-dependent*/ ehb /* Clear execution hazards to prevent speculative walks*/ ginvt r1, type /* Invalidate TLB(s) */ sync 0x14 /* Enforce completion */ jr.hb ra /* Clear instruction hazards */ Whether the hardware page table walker, if implemented, needs to be disabled as shown above, is implementation dependent. It is recommended that hardware take the steps to locally disable the hardware page table walker to main- tain TLB consistency, as it would for remote TLBs. Software must take into account a system that may have potentially varying widths of MemoryMapID . While not rec- ommended, different processors may have different implemented or programmed widths. Further, the interface between processors may support yet another width. If this is the case, then software responsible for global invalidates should be run on the processor with maximum width. Software must zero-fill any bits that are unused by a target. Software should also be able to rely on the implementation zero-filling bits where widths increase across any inter- face. If an intermediate interface between source and target truncates the width of MemoryMapID, then software could address this limitation through various means: It could restrict the use of MemoryMapID to the interface width, it could program MemoryMapID with the expectation that over-invalidation may occur, or it should default to legacy means of invalidating the caches to prevent unreliable system behavior.

JALR.HB implements a software barrier that resolves all execution and instruction hazards created by Coprocessor 0 state changes (for Release 2 implementations, refer to the SYNCI instruction for additional information on resolving instruction hazards created by writing the instruction stream). The effects of this barrier are seen starting with the instruction fetch and decode of the instruction at the PC to which the JALR.HB instruction jumps. An equivalent bar- rier is also implemented by the ERET instruction, but that instruction is only available if access to Coprocessor 0 is enabled, whereas JALR.HB is legal in all operating modes. This instruction clears both execution and instruction hazards. Refer to the EHB instruction description for the method of clearing execution hazards alone. JALR.HB uses bit 10 of the instruction (the upper bit of the hint field) to denote the hazard barrier operation. Restrictions: JALR.HB does not clear hazards created by any instruction that is executed in the delay slot of the JALR.HB. Only hazards created by instructions executed before the JALR.HB are cleared by the JALR.HB.

Release 6 JR.HB rs is implemented as JALR.HB r0,rs. For example, as JALR.HB with the destination set to the zero register, r0. This instruction implements the final step in clearing execution and instruction hazards before execution continues. A hazard is created when a Coprocessor 0 or TLB write affects execution or the mapping of the instruction stream, or after a write to the instruction stream. When such a situation exists, software must explicitly indicate to hardware that the hazard should be cleared. Execution hazards alone can be cleared with the EHB instruction. Instruction hazards can only be cleared with a JR.HB, JALR.HB, or ERET instruction. These instructions cause hardware to clear the hazard before the instruction at the target of the jump is fetched. Note that because these instructions are encoded as jumps, the process of clearing an instruction hazard can often be included as part of a call (JALR) or return (JR) sequence, by simply replacing the original instructions with the HB equivalent.

Control Transfer Instructions (CTIs) should not be placed in branch delay slots. CTIs include all branches and jumps, NAL, ERET, ERETNC, DERET, WAIT, and PAUSE. Processor operation is UNPREDICTABLE if a control transfer instruction (CTI) is placed in the delay slot of a branch or jump. Availability and Compatibility: If the microMIPS base architecture is not implemented and the MIPS16e ASE is not implemented, a Reserved Instruction exception is initiated. The JALX instruction has been removed in Release 6. Pre-Release 6 code using JALX cannot run on Release 6 by trap-and-emulate.

","JR.HB Jump Register with Hazard Barrier 208 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 Format: JR.HB rs MIPS32 Release 2 Assembly idiom Release 6 Purpose: Jump Register with Hazard Barrier To execute a branch to an instruction address in a register and clear all execution and instruction hazards. Description: PC  GPR[rs], clear execution and instruction hazards Jump to the effective target address in GPR rs. Execute the instruction following the jump, in the branch delay slot, before jumping. For processors that do not implement the MIPS16e or microMIPS ISA: • Jump to the effective target address in GPR rs. If the target address is not 4-byte aligned, an Address Error exception will occur when the target address is fetched. For processors that do implement the MIPS16e or microMIPS ISA: • Jump to the effective target address in GPR rs. Set the ISA Mode bit to the value in GPR rs bit 0. Set bit 0 of the target address to zero. If the target ISA Mode bit is 0 and the target address is not 4-byte aligned, an Address Error exception will occur when the target instruction is fetched. JR.HB implements a software barrier that resolves all execution and instruction hazards created by Coprocessor 0 state changes (for Release 2 implementations, refer to the SYNCI instruction for additional information on resolving instruction hazards created by writing the instruction stream). The effects of this barrier are seen starting with the instruction fetch and decode of the instruction at the PC to which the JR.HB instruction jumps. An equivalent barrier is also implemented by the ERET instruction, but that instruction is only available if access to Coprocessor 0 is enabled, whereas JR.HB is legal in all operating modes. This instruction clears both execution and instruction hazards. Refer to the EHB instruction description for the method of clearing execution hazards alone. JR.HB uses bit 10 of the instruction (the upper bit of the hint field) to denote the hazard barrier operation. Restrictions: JR.HB does not clear hazards created by any instruction that is executed in the delay slot of the JR.HB. Only hazards created by instructions executed before the JR.HB are cleared by the JR.HB. After modifying an instruction stream mapping or writing to the instruction stream, execution of those instructions has UNPREDICTABLE behavior until the hazard has been cleared with JALR.HB, JR.HB, ERET, or DERET. Fur- ther, the operation is UNPREDICTABLE if the mapping of the current instruction stream is modified.

A hazard is created when a Coprocessor 0 or TLB write affects execution or the mapping of the instruction stream, or after a write to the instruction stream. When such a situation exists, software must explicitly indicate to hardware that the hazard should be cleared. Execution hazards alone can be cleared with the EHB instruction. Instruction hazards can only be cleared with a JR.HB, JALR.HB, or ERET instruction. These instructions cause hardware to clear the hazard before the instruction at the target of the jump is fetched.

Description: CPR[0, rd, sel]  GPR[rt] The contents of general register rt are loaded into the coprocessor 0 register specified by the combination of rd and sel. Not all coprocessor 0 registers support the sel field. In those instances, the sel field must be set to zero. In Release 5, for a 32-bit processor, the MTC0 instruction writes all zeroes to the high-order bits of selected CP0 reg- isters that have been extended beyond 32 bits. This is required for compatibility with legacy software that does not use MTHC0, yet has hardware support for extended CP0 registers (such as for Extended Physical Addressing (XPA)). Because MTC0 overwrites the result of MTHC0, software must first read the high-order bits before writing the low- order bits, then write the high-order bits back either modified or unmodified. For initialization of an extended register, software may first write the low-order bits, then the high-order bits, without first reading the high-order bits. Restrictions: Pre-Release 6: The results are UNDEFINED if coprocessor 0 does not contain a register as specified by rd and sel.

NAL was originally an alias for pre-Release 6 instruction BLTZAL. The condition is false, so the 16-bit target offset field is ignored, but the link register, GPR 31, is unconditionally written with the address of the instruction past the delay slot.

It is strongly recommended not to use this deprecated instructions because it will be removed from a future revision of the MIPS Architecture. The pre-Release 6 instruction BLTZAL when rs is not GPR[0], is removed in Release 6, and is required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception. Release 6 adds BLTZALC, the equivalent compact conditional branch and link, with no delay slot. This instruction, NAL, is introduced by and required as of Release 6, the mnemonic NAL becomes distinguished from the BLTZAL instruction removed in Release 6.

Description: FPR[fd]  -FPR[fs] The value in FPR fs is negated and placed into FPR fd. The value is negated by changing the sign bit value. The oper- and and result are values in format fmt. NEG.PS negates the upper and lower halves of FPR fs independently, and ORs together any generated exceptional conditions. If FIR Has2008 =0 or FCSR ABS2008 =0 then this operation is arithmetic. For this case, any NaN operand signals invalid operation. If FCSR ABS2008 =1 then this operation is non-arithmetic. For this case, both regular floating point numbers and NAN values are treated alike, only the sign bit is affected by this instruction. No IEEE 754 exception can be generated for this case, and the FCSR Cause and FCSR Flags fields are not modified. Restrictions: The fields fs and fd must specify FPRs valid for operands of type fmt. If the fields are not valid, the result is UNPRE- DICTABLE. The operand must be a value in format fmt; if it is not, the result is UNPREDICTABLE and the value of the operand FPR becomes UNPREDICTABLE.

Description: Locks implemented using the LL/SC instructions are a common method of synchronization between threads of con- trol. A lock implementation does a load-linked instruction and checks the value returned to determine whether the software lock is set. If it is, the code branches back to retry the load-linked instruction, implementing an active busy- wait sequence. The PAUSE instruction is intended to be placed into the busy-wait sequence to block the instruction stream until such time as the load-linked instruction has a chance to succeed in obtaining the software lock. The PAUSE instruction is implementation-dependent, but it usually involves descheduling the instruction stream until the LLBit is zero. • In a single-threaded processor, this may be implemented as a short-term WAIT operation which resumes at the next instruction when the LLBit is zero or on some other external event such as an interrupt. • On a multi-threaded processor, this may be implemented as a short term YIELD operation which resumes at the next instruction when the LLBit is zero. In either case, it is assumed that the instruction stream which gives up the software lock does so via a write to the lock variable, which causes the processor to clear the LLBit as seen by this thread of execution. The encoding of the instruction is such that it is backward compatible with all previous implementations of the archi- tecture. The PAUSE instruction can therefore be placed into existing lock sequences and treated as a NOP by the pro- cessor, even if the processor does not implement the PAUSE instruction. Restrictions: Pre-Release 6: The operation of the processor is UNPREDICTABLE if a PAUSE instruction is executed placed in the delay slot of a branch or jump instruction. Release 6: Implementations are required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception if PAUSE is encountered in the delay slot or forbidden slot of a branch or jump instruction. Operations: if LLBit ≠ 0 then EPC  PC + 4 /* Resume at the following instruction */ DescheduleInstructionStream() endif Exceptions: None Programming Notes: The PAUSE instruction is intended to be inserted into the instruction stream after an LL instruction has set the LLBit and found the software lock set. The program may wait forever if a PAUSE instruction is executed and there is no possibility that the LLBit will ever be cleared.

Description: prefetch_memory(GPR[base] + offset) PREF adds the signed offset to the contents of GPR base to form an effective byte address. The hint field supplies information about the way that the data is expected to be used. PREF enables the processor to take some action, typically causing data to be moved to or from the cache, to improve program performance. The action taken for a specific PREF instruction is both system and context dependent. Any action, including doing nothing, is permitted as long as it does not change architecturally visible state or alter the meaning of a program. Implementations are expected either to do nothing, or to take an action that increases the per- formance of the program. The PrepareForStore function is unique in that it may modify the architecturally visible state. PREF does not cause addressing-related exceptions, including TLB exceptions. If the address specified would cause an addressing exception, the exception condition is ignored and no data movement occurs.However even if no data is moved, some action that is not architecturally visible, such as writeback of a dirty cache line, can take place. It is implementation dependent whether a Bus Error or Cache Error exception is reported if such an error is detected as a byproduct of the action taken by the PREF instruction. PREF neither generates a memory operation nor modifies the state of a cache line for a location with an uncached memory access type, whether this type is specified by the address segment (e.g., kseg1), the programmed cacheability and coherency attribute of a segment (e.g., the use of the K0, KU, or K23 fields in the Config register), or the per- page cacheability and coherency attribute provided by the TLB. If PREF results in a memory operation, the memory access type and cacheability&coherency attribute used for the operation are determined by the memory access type and cacheability&coherency attribute of the effective address, just as it would be if the memory operation had been caused by a load or store to the effective address. For a cached location, the expected and useful action for the processor is to prefetch a block of data that includes the effective address. The size of the block and the level of the memory hierarchy it is fetched into are implementation specific. In coherent multiprocessor implementations, if the effective address uses a coherent Cacheability and Coherency Attribute (CCA), then the instruction causes a coherent memory transaction to occur. This means a prefetch issued on one processor can cause data to be evicted from the cache in another processor. The PREF instruction and the memory transactions which are sourced by the PREF instruction, such as cache refill or cache writeback, obey the ordering and completion rules of the SYNC instruction. pre-Release 6 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 0 PREF 110011 base hint offset 6 5 5 16 Release 6 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 7 6 5 0 SPECIAL3 011111 base hint offset 0 PREF 110101 6 5 5 9 1 6 ","PREF IPrefetch The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 322 Table 5.2 Values of hint Field for PREF Instruction Value Name Data Use and Desired Prefetch Action 0 load Use: Prefetched data is expected to be read (not modified).

As shown in the instruction drawing above, Release 6 implements a 9-bit offset, whereas all release levels lower than Release 6 of the MIPS architecture implement a 16-bit offset. Prefetch cannot move data to or from a mapped location unless the translation for that location is present in the TLB. Locations in memory pages that have not been accessed recently may not have translations in the TLB, so prefetch may not be effective for such locations. Prefetch does not cause addressing exceptions. A prefetch may be used using an address pointer before the validity of the pointer is determined without worrying about an addressing exception. It is implementation dependent whether a Bus Error or Cache Error exception is reported if such an error is detected as a byproduct of the action taken by the PREF instruction. Typically, this only occurs in systems which have high- reliability requirements. Prefetch operations have no effect on cache lines that were previously locked with the CACHE instruction. Hint field encodings whose function is described as “streamed” or “retained” convey usage intent from software to hardware. Software should not assume that hardware will always prefetch data in an optimal way. If data is to be truly retained, software should use the Cache instruction to lock data into the cache. ","PREFE Prefetch EVA 325 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 Format: PREFE hint,offset(base) MIPS32 Purpose: Prefetch EVA To move data between user mode virtual address space memory and cache while operating in kernel mode. Description: prefetch_memory(GPR[base] + offset) PREFE adds the 9-bit signed offset to the contents of GPR base to form an effective byte address. The hint field sup- plies information about the way that the data is expected to be used. PREFE enables the processor to take some action, causing data to be moved to or from the cache, to improve program performance. The action taken for a specific PREFE instruction is both system and context dependent. Any action, including doing nothing, is permitted as long as it does not change architecturally visible state or alter the meaning of a program. Implementations are expected either to do nothing, or to take an action that increases the performance of the program. The PrepareForStore function is unique in that it may modify the architecturally visible state. PREFE does not cause addressing-related exceptions, including TLB exceptions. If the address specified would cause an addressing exception, the exception condition is ignored and no data movement occurs.However even if no data is moved, some action that is not architecturally visible, such as writeback of a dirty cache line, can take place. It is implementation dependent whether a Bus Error or Cache Error exception is reported if such an error is detected as a byproduct of the action taken by the PREFE instruction. PREFE neither generates a memory operation nor modifies the state of a cache line for a location with an uncached memory access type, whether this type is specified by the address segment (for example, kseg1), the programmed cacheability and coherency attribute of a segment (for example, the use of the K0, KU, or K23 fields in the Config register), or the per-page cacheability and coherency attribute provided by the TLB. If PREFE results in a memory operation, the memory access type and cacheability & coherency attribute used for the operation are determined by the memory access type and cacheability & coherency attribute of the effective address, just as it would be if the memory operation had been caused by a load or store to the effective address. For a cached location, the expected and useful action for the processor is to prefetch a block of data that includes the effective address. The size of the block and the level of the memory hierarchy it is fetched into are implementation specific. In coherent multiprocessor implementations, if the effective address uses a coherent Cacheability and Coherency Attribute (CCA), then the instruction causes a coherent memory transaction to occur. This means a prefetch issued on one processor can cause data to be evicted from the cache in another processor. The PREFE instruction and the memory transactions which are sourced by the PREFE instruction, such as cache refill or cache writeback, obey the ordering and completion rules of the SYNC instruction. The PREFE instruction functions in exactly the same fashion as the PREF instruction, except that address translation is performed using the user mode virtual address space mapping in the TLB when accessing an address within a memory segment configured to use the MUSUK access mode. Memory segments using UUSK or MUSK access modes are also accessible. Refer to Volume III, Enhanced Virtual Addressing section for additional information.

Table 5.3 Values of hint Field for PREFE Instruction (Continued) Value Name Data Use and Desired Prefetch Action ","PREFE IPrefetch EVA The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 328 Prefetch cannot move data to or from a mapped location unless the translation for that location is present in the TLB. Locations in memory pages that have not been accessed recently may not have translations in the TLB, so prefetch may not be effective for such locations. Prefetch does not cause addressing exceptions. A prefetch may be used using an address pointer before the validity of the pointer is determined without worrying about an addressing exception. It is implementation dependent whether a Bus Error or Cache Error exception is reported if such an error is detected as a byproduct of the action taken by the PREFE instruction. Typically, this only occurs in systems which have high- reliability requirements. Prefetch operations have no effect on cache lines that were previously locked with the CACHE instruction. Hint field encodings whose function is described as “streamed” or “retained” convey usage intent from software to hardware. Software should not assume that hardware will always prefetch data in an optimal way. If data is to be truly retained, software should use the Cache instruction to lock data into the cache.

In Release 5, the behavior of SC is modified when Config5 LLB =1. Release 6 (with Config5 ULS =1) formalizes support for uncached LL and SC sequences, whereas the pre-Release 6 LL and SC description applies to cached (coherent/non-coherent) memory types. (The description for uncached sup- port does not modify the description for cached support and is written in a self-contained manner.) The 32-bit word in GPR rt is conditionally stored in memory at the location specified by the aligned effective address. The signed offset is added to the contents of GPR base to form an effective address. The SC completes the RMW sequence begun by the preceding LL instruction executed on the processor. To complete the RMW sequence atomically, the following occur: • The 32-bit word of GPR rt is stored to memory at the location specified by the aligned effective address. • A one, indicating success, is written into GPR rt. Otherwise, memory is not modified and a 0, indicating failure, is written into GPR rt. If either of the following events occurs between the execution of LL and SC, the SC fails: • A coherent store is completed by another processor or coherent I/O module into the block of synchronizable physical memory containing the word. The size and alignment of the block is implementation-dependent, but it is at least one word and at most the minimum page size. • A coherent store is executed between an LL and SC sequence on the same processor to the block of synchroniz- able physical memory containing the word (if Config5 LLB =1; else whether such a store causes the SC to fail is not predictable). • An ERET instruction is executed. (Release 5 includes ERETNC, which will not cause the SC to fail.) Furthermore, an SC must always compare its address against that of the LL. An SC will fail if the aligned address of the SC does not match that of the preceding LL. A load that executes on the processor executing the LL/SC sequence to the block of synchronizable physical memory containing the word, will not cause the SC to fail (if Config5 LLB =1; else such a load may cause the SC to fail).

Portable programs should not cause any of these events. • A load or store executed on the processor executing the LL and SC that is not to the block of synchronizable physical memory containing the word. (The load or store may cause a cache eviction between the LL and SC that results in SC failure. The load or store does not necessarily have to occur between the LL and SC.) • Any prefetch that is executed on the processor executing the LL and SC sequence (due to a cache eviction between the LL and SC). • A non-coherent store executed between an LL and SC sequence to the block of synchronizable physical memory containing the word. • The instructions executed starting with the LL and ending with the SC do not lie in a 2048-byte contiguous region of virtual memory. (The region does not have to be aligned, other than the alignment required for instruc- tion words.) CACHE operations that are local to the processor executing the LL/SC sequence will result in unpredictable behav- iour of the SC if executed between the LL and SC, that is, they may cause the SC to fail where it could have suc- ceeded. Non-local CACHE operations (address-type with coherent CCA) may cause an SC to fail on either the local processor or on the remote processor in multiprocessor or multi-threaded systems. This definition of the effects of CACHE operations is mandated if Config5 LLB =1. If Config5 LLB =0, then CACHE effects are implementation-depen- dent. The following conditions must be true or the result of the SC is not predictable—the SC may fail or succeed (if Config5 LLB =1, then either success or failure is mandated, else the result is UNPREDICTABLE): • Execution of SC must have been preceded by execution of an LL instruction. • An RMW sequence executed without intervening events that would cause the SC to fail must use the same address in the LL and SC. The address is the same if the virtual address, physical address, and cacheability & coherency attribute are identical. Atomic RMW is provided only for synchronizable memory locations. A synchronizable memory location is one that is associated with the state and logic necessary to implement the LL/SC semantics. Whether a memory location is synchronizable depends on the processor and system configurations, and on the memory access type used for the location: • Uniprocessor atomicity: To provide atomic RMW on a single processor, all accesses to the location must be made with memory access type of either cached noncoherent or cached coherent. All accesses must be to one or the other access type, and they may not be mixed. • MP atomicity: To provide atomic RMW among multiple processors, all accesses to the location must be made with a memory access type of cached coherent. • I/O System: To provide atomic RMW with a coherent I/O system, all accesses to the location must be made with a memory access type of cached coherent. If the I/O system does not use coherent memory operations, then atomic RMW cannot be provided with respect to the I/O reads and writes. Release 6 (with Config5 ULS =1) formally defines support for uncached LL and SC with the following constraints. • Both LL and SC must be uncached, and the address must be defined as synchronizable in the system. If the address is non-synchronizable, then this may result in UNPREDICTABLE behavior. The recommended response is that the sub-system report a Bus Error to the processor. • The use of uncached LL and SC is applicable to any address within the supported address range of the system, or any system configuration, as long as the system implements means to monitor the sequence. • The SC that ends the sequence may fail locally, but never succeed locally within the processor. When it does not fail locally, the SC must be issued to a “monitor” which is responsible for monitoring the address. This monitor ","SC IStore Conditional Word The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 349 makes the final determination as to whether the SC fails or not, and communicates this to the processor that initi- ated the sequence. It is implementation dependent as to what form the monitor takes. It is however differentiated from cached LL and SC which rely on a coherence protocol to make the determination as to whether the sequence succeeds. • Same processor uncached (but not cached) stores will cause the sequence to fail if the store address matches that of the sequence. A cached store to the same address will cause UNPREDICTABLE behavior. • Remote cached coherent stores to the same address will cause UNPREDICTABLE behavior. • Remote cached non-coherent or uncached stores may cause the sequence to fail if they address the external mon- itor and the monitor makes this determination. As emphasized above, it is not recommended that software mix memory access types during LL and SC sequences. That is all memory accesses must be of the same type, otherwise this may result in UNPREDICTABLE behavior. Conditions that cause UNPREDICTABLE behavior for legacy cached LL and SC sequences may also cause such behavior for uncached sequences. A PAUSE instruction is no-op’d when it is preceded by an uncached LL. The semantics of an uncached LL/SC atomic operation applies to any uncached CCA including UCA (UnCached Accelerated). An implementation that supports UCA must guarantee that SC does not participate in store gathering and that it ends any gathering initiated by stores preceding the SC in program order when the SC address coincides with a gathering address. Restrictions: The addressed location must have a memory access type of cached noncoherent or cached coherent; if it does not, the result is UNPREDICTABLE. Release 6 (with Config5 ULS =1) extends support to uncached types. The effective address must be naturally-aligned. If either of the 2 least-significant bits of the address is non-zero, an Address Error exception occurs. Providing misaligned support for Release 6 is not a requirement for this instruction.

Description: SSNOP is the assembly idiom used to denote superscalar no operation. The actual instruction is interpreted by the hardware as SLL r0, r0, 1. This instruction alters the instruction issue behavior on a superscalar processor by forcing the SSNOP instruction to single-issue. The processor must then end the current instruction issue between the instruction previous to the SSNOP and the SSNOP. The SSNOP then issues alone in the next issue slot. On a single-issue processor, this instruction is a NOP that takes an issue slot. Restrictions: None Availability and Compatibility Release 6: the special no-operation instruction SSNOP is deprecated: it behaves the same as a conventional NOP. Its special behavior with respect to instruction issue is no longer guaranteed. The EHB and JR.HB instructions are pro- vided to clear execution and instruction hazards. Assemblers targeting specifically Release 6 should reject the SSNOP instruction with an error. Operation: None Exceptions: None Programming Notes: SSNOP is intended for use primarily to allow the programmer control over CP0 hazards by converting instructions into cycles in a superscalar processor. For example, to insert at least two cycles between an MTC0 and an ERET, one would use the following sequence: mtc0 x,y ssnop ssnop eret The MTC0 issues in cycle T. Because the SSNOP instructions must issue alone, they may issue no earlier than cycle T+1 and cycle T+2, respectively. Finally, the ERET issues no earlier than cycle T+3. Although the instruction after an SSNOP may issue no earlier than the cycle after the SSNOP is issued, that instruction may issue later. This is because other implementation-dependent issue rules may apply that prevent an issue in the next cycle. Processors should not introduce any unnecessary delay in issuing SSNOP instructions. 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 11 10 6 5 0 SPECIAL 000000 0 00000 0 00000 0 00000 1 00001 SLL 000000 6 5 5 5 5 6 ","SUB Subtract Word 388 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 Format: SUB rd, rs, rt MIPS32 Purpose: Subtract Word To subtract 32-bit integers.

Release 6 (with Config5 GI =10/11) extends SYNC for Global Invalidate instructions (GINVI/GINVT). Description: These types of ordering guarantees are available through the SYNC instruction: • Completion Barriers • Ordering Barriers Completion Barrier — Simple Description: • The barrier affects only uncached and cached coherent loads and stores. • The specified memory instructions (loads or stores or both) that occur before the SYNC instruction must be completed before the specified memory instructions after the SYNC are allowed to start. • Loads are completed when the destination register is written. Stores are completed when the stored value is visible to every other processor in the system. Completion Barrier — Detailed Description: • Every synchronizable specified memory instruction (loads or stores or both) that occurs in the instruction stream before the SYNC instruction must be already globally performed before any synchronizable speci- fied memory instructions that occur after the SYNC are allowed to be performed, with respect to any other processor or coherent I/O module. • The barrier does not guarantee the order in which instruction fetches are performed. • A stype value of zero will always be defined such that it performs the most complete set of synchronization operations that are defined.This means stype zero always does a completion barrier that affects both loads and stores preceding the SYNC instruction and both loads and stores that are subsequent to the SYNC instruction. Non-zero values of stype may be defined by the architecture or specific implementations to per- form synchronization behaviors that are less complete than that of stype zero. If an implementation does not use one of these non-zero values to define a different synchronization behavior, then that non-zero value of stype must act the same as stype zero completion barrier. This allows software written for an implementation with a lighter-weight barrier to work on another implementation which only implements the stype zero com- pletion barrier. • A completion barrier is required, potentially in conjunction with SSNOP (in Release 1 of the Architecture) or EHB (in Release 2 of the Architecture), to guarantee that memory reference results are visible across operating mode changes. For example, a completion barrier is required on some implementations on entry to and exit from Debug Mode to guarantee that memory effects are handled correctly. 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 11 10 6 5 0 SPECIAL 000000 0 00 0000 0000 0000 0 stype SYNC 001111 6 15 5 6 ","SYNC Synchronize Shared Memory 408 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 SYNC behavior when the stype field is zero: • A completion barrier that affects preceding loads and stores and subsequent loads and stores. Ordering Barrier — Simple Description: • The barrier affects only uncached and cached coherent loads and stores. • The specified memory instructions (loads or stores or both) that occur before the SYNC instruction must always be ordered before the specified memory instructions after the SYNC. • Memory instructions which are ordered before other memory instructions are processed by the load/store datapath first before the other memory instructions. Ordering Barrier — Detailed Description: • Every synchronizable specified memory instruction (loads or stores or both) that occurs in the instruction stream before the SYNC instruction must reach a stage in the load/store datapath after which no instruction re-ordering is possible before any synchronizable specified memory instruction which occurs after the SYNC instruction in the instruction stream reaches the same stage in the load/store datapath. • If any memory instruction before the SYNC instruction in program order, generates a memory request to the external memory and any memory instruction after the SYNC instruction in program order also generates a memory request to external memory, the memory request belonging to the older instruction must be globally performed before the time the memory request belonging to the younger instruction is globally performed. • The barrier does not guarantee the order in which instruction fetches are performed. As compared to the completion barrier, the ordering barrier is a lighter-weight operation as it does not require the specified instructions before the SYNC to be already completed. Instead it only requires that those specified instruc- tions which are subsequent to the SYNC in the instruction stream are never re-ordered for processing ahead of the specified instructions which are before the SYNC in the instruction stream. This potentially reduces how many cycles the barrier instruction must stall before it completes. The Acquire and Release barrier types are used to minimize the memory orderings that must be maintained and still have software synchronization work. Implementations that do not use any of the non-zero values of stype to define different barriers, such as ordering bar- riers, must make those stype values act the same as stype zero. For the purposes of this description, the CACHE, PREF and PREFX instructions are treated as loads and stores. That is, these instructions and the memory transactions sourced by these instructions obey the ordering and completion rules of the SYNC instruction. If Global Invalidate instructions are supported in Release 6, then SYNC (stype=0x14) acts as a completion barrier to ensure completion of any preceding GINVI or GINVT operation. This SYNC operation is globalized and only com- pletes if all preceding GINVI or GINVT operations related to the same program have completed in the system. (Any references to GINVT also imply GINVGT, available in a virtualized MIPS system. GINVT however will be used exclusively.) A system that implements the Global Invalidates also requires that the completion of this SYNC be constrained by legacy SYNCI operations. Thus SYNC (stype=0x14) can also be used to determine whether preceding (in program order) SYNCI operations have completed. ","SYNC ISynchronize Shared Memory The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 409 The SYNC (stype=0x14) also act as an ordering barrier as described in Table 5.5. In the typical use cases, a single GINVI is used by itself to invalidate caches and would be followed by a SYNC (stype=0x14). In the case of GINVT, multiple GINVT could be used to invalidate multiple TLB mappings, and the SYNC (stype=0x14) would be used to guaranteed completion of any number of GINVTs preceding it.

","SYNC Synchronize Shared Memory 410 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 Terms: Synchronizable: A load or store instruction is synchronizable if the load or store occurs to a physical location in shared memory using a virtual location with a memory access type of either uncached or cached coherent. Shared memory is memory that can be accessed by more than one processor or by a coherent I/O system module. Performed load: A load instruction is performed when the value returned by the load has been determined. The result of a load on processor A has been determined with respect to processor or coherent I/O module B when a subsequent store to the location by B cannot affect the value returned by the load. The store by B must use the same memory access type as the load. Performed store: A store instruction is performed when the store is observable. A store on processor A is observable with respect to processor or coherent I/O module B when a subsequent load of the location by B returns the value written by the store. The load by B must use the same memory access type as the store. Globally performed load: A load instruction is globally performed when it is performed with respect to all processors and coherent I/O modules capable of storing to the location. Globally performed store: A store instruction is globally performed when it is globally observable. It is globally observable when it is observable by all processors and I/O modules capable of loading from the location. Coherent I/O module: A coherent I/O module is an Input/Output system component that performs coherent Direct Memory Access (DMA). It reads and writes memory independently as though it were a processor doing loads and stores to locations with a memory access type of cached coherent. Load/Store Datapath: The portion of the processor which handles the load/store data requests coming from the pro- cessor pipeline and processes those requests within the cache and memory system hierarchy. Restrictions: The effect of SYNC on the global order of loads and stores for memory access types other than uncached and cached coherent is UNPREDICTABLE. Operation: SyncOperation(stype) Exceptions: None Programming Notes: A processor executing load and store instructions observes the order in which loads and stores using the same mem- ory access type occur in the instruction stream; this is known as program order . A parallel program has multiple instruction streams that can execute simultaneously on different processors. In mul- tiprocessor (MP) systems, the order in which the effects of loads and stores are observed by other processors—the global order of the loads and store—determines the actions necessary to reliably share data in parallel programs. When all processors observe the effects of loads and stores in program order, the system is strongly ordered. On such systems, parallel programs can reliably share data without explicit actions in the programs. For such a system, SYNC has the same effect as a NOP. Executing SYNC on such a system is not necessary, but neither is it an error. If a multiprocessor system is not strongly ordered, the effects of load and store instructions executed by one processor may be observed out of program order by other processors. On such systems, parallel programs must take explicit actions to reliably share data. At critical points in the program, the effects of loads and stores from an instruction stream must occur in the same order for all processors. SYNC separates the loads and stores executed on the proces- sor into two groups, and the effect of all loads and stores in one group is seen by all processors before the effect of any load or store in the subsequent group. In effect, SYNC causes the system to be strongly ordered for the executing processor at the instant that the SYNC is executed. ","SYNC ISynchronize Shared Memory The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 411 Many MIPS-based multiprocessor systems are strongly ordered or have a mode in which they operate as strongly ordered for at least one memory access type. The MIPS architecture also permits implementation of MP systems that are not strongly ordered; SYNC enables the reliable use of shared memory on such systems. A parallel program that does not use SYNC generally does not operate on a system that is not strongly ordered. However, a program that does use SYNC works on both types of systems. (System-specific documentation describes the actions needed to reliably share data in parallel programs for that system.) The behavior of a load or store using one memory access type is UNPREDICTABLE if a load or store was previ- ously made to the same physical location using a different memory access type. The presence of a SYNC between the references does not alter this behavior. SYNC affects the order in which the effects of load and store instructions appear to all processors; it does not gener- ally affect the physical memory-system ordering or synchronization issues that arise in system programming. The effect of SYNC on implementation-specific aspects of the cached memory system, such as writeback buffers, is not defined. # Processor A (writer) # Conditions at entry: # The value 0 has been stored in FLAG and that value is observable by B SW R1, DATA # change shared DATA value LI R2, 1 SYNC # Perform DATA store before performing FLAG store SW R2, FLAG # say that the shared DATA value is valid # Processor B (reader) LI R2, 1 1: LW R1, FLAG # Get FLAG BNE R2, R1, 1B# if it says that DATA is not valid, poll again NOP SYNC # FLAG value checked before doing DATA read LW R1, DATA # Read (valid) shared DATA value The code fragments above shows how SYNC can be used to coordinate the use of shared data between separate writer and reader instruction streams in a multiprocessor environment. The FLAG location is used by the instruction streams to determine whether the shared data item DATA is valid. The SYNC executed by processor A forces the store of DATA to be performed globally before the store to FLAG is performed. The SYNC executed by processor B ensures that DATA is not read until after the FLAG value indicates that the shared data is valid. ","SYNCI Synchronize Caches to Make Instruction Writes Effective 412 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 Format: SYNCI offset(base) MIPS32 Release 2 Purpose: Synchronize Caches to Make Instruction Writes Effective To synchronize all caches to make instruction writes effective. Description: This instruction is used after a new instruction stream is written to make the new instructions effective relative to an instruction fetch, when used in conjunction with the SYNC and JALR.HB, JR.HB, or ERET instructions, as described below. Unlike the CACHE instruction, the SYNCI instruction is available in all operating modes in an implementation of Release 2 of the architecture. The 16-bit offset is sign-extended and added to the contents of the base register to form an effective address. The effective address is used to address the cache line in all caches which may need to be synchronized with the write of the new instructions. The operation occurs only on the cache line which may contain the effective address. One SYNCI instruction is required for every cache line that was written. See the Programming Notes below. A TLB Refill and TLB Invalid (both with cause code equal TLBL) exception can occur as a by product of this instruction. This instruction never causes TLB Modified exceptions nor TLB Refill exceptions with a cause code of TLBS. This instruction never causes Execute-Inhibit nor Read-Inhibit exceptions. A Cache Error exception may occur as a by product of this instruction. For example, if a writeback operation detects a cache or bus error during the processing of the operation, that error is reported via a Cache Error exception. Simi- larly, a Bus Error Exception may occur if a bus operation invoked by this instruction is terminated in an error. An Address Error Exception (with cause code equal AdEL) may occur if the effective address references a portion of the kernel address space which would normally result in such an exception. It is implementation dependent whether such an exception does occur. It is implementation dependent whether a data watch is triggered by a SYNCI instruction whose address matches the Watch register address match conditions. Restrictions: The operation of the processor is UNPREDICTABLE if the effective address references any instruction cache line that contains instructions to be executed between the SYNCI and the subsequent JALR.HB, JR.HB, or ERET instruc- tion required to clear the instruction hazard. The SYNCI instruction has no effect on cache lines that were previously locked with the CACHE instruction. If cor- rect software operation depends on the state of a locked line, the CACHE instruction must be used to synchronize the caches. Full visibility of the new instruction stream requires execution of a subsequent SYNC instruction, followed by a JALR.HB, JR.HB, DERET, or ERET instruction. The operation of the processor is UNPREDICTABLE if this sequence is not followed. SYNCI globalization: The SYNCI instruction acts on the current processor at a minimum. Implementations are required to affect caches outside the current processor to perform the operation on the current processor (as might be the case if multiple pro- cessors share an L2 or L3 cache).

In multiprocessor implementations where instruction caches are not coherently maintained by hardware, the SYNCI instruction may optionally affect all coherent icaches within the system. If the effective address uses a coherent Cacheability and Coherency Attribute (CCA), then the operation may be globalized, meaning it is broadcast to all of the coherent instruction caches within the system. If the effective address does not use one of the coherent CCAs, there is no broadcast of the SYNCI operation. If multiple levels of caches are to be affected by one SYNCI instruc- tion, all of the affected cache levels must be processed in the same manner - either all affected cache levels use the globalized behavior or all affected cache levels use the non-globalized behavior. Pre-Release 6: Portable software could not rely on the optional globalization of SYNCI. Strictly portable software without implementation specific awareness could only rely on expensive “instruction cache shootdown” using inter- processor interrupts. Release 6: SYNCI globalization is required. Compliant implementations must globalize SYNCI, and portable soft- ware can rely on this behavior.

The following example shows a routine which can be called after the new instruction stream is written to make those changes effective. The SYNCI instruction could be replaced with the corresponding sequence of CACHE instructions (when access to Coprocessor 0 is available), and that the JR.HB instruction could be replaced with JALR.HB, ERET, or DERET instructions, as appropriate. A SYNC instruction is required between the final SYNCI instruction in the loop and the instruction that clears instruction hazards. /* * This routine makes changes to the instruction stream effective to the * hardware.

Support for TLBINVF is recommend for implementations supporting VTLB/FTLB type of MMU. Implementation of the EntryHI EHINV field is required for implementation of TLBINV and TLBINVF instructions. Description: On execution of the TLBINVF instruction, all entries within range of Index are invalidated. Behavior of the TLBINVF instruction applies to all applicable TLB entries and is unaffected by the setting of the Wired register. • For JTLB-based MMU (Config MT =1): TLBINVF causes all entries in the JTLB to be invalidated. Index is unused. • For VTLB/FTLB-based MMU (Config MT =4): If TLB invalidate walk is implemented in your software (Config4 IE =2), then your software must do these steps to flush the entire MMU: 1. one TLBINVF instruction is executed with an index in VTLB range (invalidates all VTLB entries) 2. a TLBINVF instruction is executed for each FTLB set (invalidates all entries in FTLB set) If TLB invalidate walk is implemented in hardware (Config4 IE =3), then software must do these steps to flush the entire MMU: 1. one TLBINVF instruction is executed (invalidates all entries in both FTLB & VTLB). In this case, Index is unused. Restrictions: When Config MT =4 and Config IE =2, the operation is UNDEFINED if the contents of the Index register are greater than or equal to the number of available TLB entries. If access to Coprocessor 0 is not enabled, a Coprocessor Unusable Exception is signaled. Availability and Compatibility: Implementation of the TLBINVF instruction is optional.

Software may use the code bits of the instruction to communicate additional information to the processor. The processor may use this information as control for the lower power mode. A value of zero for code bits is the default and must be valid in all implementations. The WAIT instruction is implemented by stalling the pipeline at the completion of the instruction and entering a lower power mode. The pipeline is restarted when an external event, such as an interrupt or external request occurs, and execution continues with the instruction following the WAIT instruction. It is implementation-dependent whether the pipeline restarts when a non-enabled interrupt is requested. In this case, software must poll for the cause of the restart. The assertion of any reset or NMI must restart the pipeline and the corresponding exception must be taken. If the pipeline restarts as the result of an enabled interrupt, that interrupt is taken between the WAIT instruction and the following instruction (EPC for the interrupt points at the instruction following the WAIT instruction). In Release 6, the behavior of WAIT has been modified to make it a requirement that a processor that has disabled operation as a result of executing a WAIT will resume operation on arrival of an interrupt even if interrupts are not enabled. In Release 6, the encoding of WAIT with bits 24:6 of the opcode set to 0 will never disable CP0 Count on an active WAIT instruction. In particular, this modification has been added to architecturally specify that CP0 Count is not dis- abled on execution of WAIT with default code of 0. Prior to Release 6, whether Count is disabled was implementa- tion-dependent. In the future, other encodings of WAIT may be defined which specify other forms of power-saving or stand-by modes. If not implemented, then such unimplemented encodings must default to WAIT 0. Restrictions: Pre-Release 6: The operation of the processor is UNDEFINED if a WAIT instruction is executed in the delay slot of a branch or jump instruction.

When encoding an instruction, the primary opcode field is encoded first. Most opcode values completely specify an instruction that has an immediate value or offset. Opcode values that do not specify an instruction instead specify an instruction class. Instructions within a class are further specified by values in other fields. For instance, opcode REGIMM specifies the immediate instruction class, which includes conditional branch and trap immediate instructions. A.2 Instruction Bit Encoding Tables This section provides various bit encoding tables for the instructions of the MIPS32® ISA. Figure A.1 shows a sample encoding table and the instruction opcode field this table encodes. Bits 31..29 of the opcode field are listed in the leftmost columns of the table. Bits 28..26 of the opcode field are listed along the topmost rows of the table. Both decimal and binary values are given, with the first three bits designating the row, and the last three bits designating the column. An instruction’s encoding is found at the intersection of a row (bits 31..29) and column (bits 28..26) value. For instance, the opcode value for the instruction labeled EX1 is 33 (decimal, row and column), or 011011 (binary). Sim- ilarly, the opcode value for EX2 is 64 (decimal), or 110100 (binary). Release 6 introduces additional nomenclature to the opcode tables for Release 6 instructions. For new instructions, bits 31:26 are generically named POPXY where X is the row number, and Y is the column number. This convention is extended to sub-opcode tables, except bits 5:0 are generically named SOPXY, where X is the row number, and Y is the column number. This naming convention is applied where a specific encoded value may be shared by multiple instructions. ","","Instruction Bit Encodings 450 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06  Operation or field codes marked with this symbol represent instructions which were only legal if 64-bit operations were enabled on implementations of Release 1 of the Architecture. In Release 2 of the architecture, operation or field codes marked with this symbol represent instructions which are legal if 64-bit floating point operations are enabled. In other cases, executing such an instruction must cause a Reserved Instruction exception (non-coprocessor encodings or coprocessor instruction encod- ings for a coprocessor to which access is allowed) or a Coprocessor Unusable Excep- tion (coprocessor instruction encodings for a coprocessor to which access is not allowed).  Instructions formerly marked  in some earlier versions of manuals, corrected and marked  in revision 5.03.

To avoid multiple conflicting instruction definitions, MIPS Technologies will assist the partner in selecting appropriate encodings if requested by the partner. The partner is not required to consult with MIPS Technologies when one of these encod- ings is used.

If the Module/ASE is not implemented, executing such an instruction must cause a Reserved Instruction exception.  Operation or field codes marked with this symbol are obsolete and will be removed from a future revision of the MIPS32 ISA.

In many cases, the old encodings for instructions moved or removed are required to signal the Reserved Instruction on Release 6, so that uses of old instructions can be trapped, and emulated or warned about; but in several cases the old encodings have been reused for new Release 6 instructions. These instruction encoding changes are indicated in the tables above. Release 6 new instructions are superscripted 6N; Release 6 removed instructions are superscripted 6R; Release 6 instructions that have been moved are marked 6Rm at the pre-Release 6 encoding that they are moved from, and 6Nm at the new Release 6 encoding that it is moved to. Encoding table cells that contain both a non-Release 6 instruction and a Release 6 instruction superscripted 6N or 6Nm indicate a possible conflict, although in many cases footnotes indicate that other fields allow the distinction to be made. The tables below show the further decoding in Release 6 for field classes (instruction encoding families) indicated in other tables. Instruction encodings are also illustrated in the instruction descriptions in Volume II. Those encodings are authorita- tive. The instruction encoding tables in this section, above, based on bitfields, are illustrative, since they cannot com- pletely indicate the new tighter encodings. MUL/DIV family encodings: Table A.23 below shows the Release 6 integer family of multiply and divide instruc- tions encodings, as well as the pre-Release 6 instructions they replace. The Release 6 and pre-Release 6 instructions share the same primary opcode, bits 31-26 = 000000, and share the function code, bits 5-0, with their pre-Release 6 counterparts, but are distinguished by bits 10-6 of the instruction. The pre-Release 6 instructions signal a Reserved Instruction exception on Release 6 implementations. However, the instruction names collide: pre-Release 6 and Release 6 DIV, DIVU, DDIV, DDIVU are actually distinct instructions, although they share the same mnemonics. The pre-Release 6 instructions produce two results, both quo- tient and remainder in the HI/LO register pair, while the Release 6 DIV instruction produce only a single result, the quotient. It is possible to distinguish the conflicting instructions in assembly by looking at how many register oper- ands the instructions have, two versus three. As of Release 6, all of pre-Release 6 instruction encodings that are removed are required to signal the reserved instruction exception, as are all in the vicinity 000000.xxxxx.xxxxx.aaaaa.011xxx, i.e. all with the primary opcodes and function codes listed in Table A.23, with the exception of the aaaaa field values 00010 and 00011 for the new instructions.

Instead of purely looking at bitfields, Release 6 defines encodings that compare different bitfields: e.g. the encoding 010110.rs rt.offset16 is BGEC if neither rs nor rt are 00000 and rs is not equal to rt, but is BGEZC if rs is the same as rt, and is BLEZC if rs is 00000 and rt is not. (The encoding with rt 00000 and arbitrary rs is the pre-Release 6 instruc- tion BLEZL.rs.00000.offset16, a branch likely instruction which is removed by Release 6, and whose encoding is required to signal the Reserved Instruction exception. ) This tight instruction encoding motivates the bitstring and constraints notation for Release 6 instruction encodings and the equivalent constraints indicated in the instruction encoding diagrams for the instruction descriptions in Vol- ume II. Table A.26 below shows the B*C compact branch encodings, which use constraints such as RS = RT. pre- Release 6 encodings that are removed by Release 6 are shaded darkly, while the remaining redundant encodings are shaded lightly or stippled. Note: Pre-Release 6 instructions BLEZL, BGTZL, BLEZ, and BGTZ do not conflict with the new Release 6 instruc- tions they are tightly packed with in the encoding tables, but the ADDI, DADDI, LWC2, SWC2, LDC2 and SDC2 truly conflict.

Changes in this revision include: • Correct the target GPR (from rd to rt) in the SLTI and SLTIU instructions. This appears to be a day-one bug. • Correct CPR number, and missing data movement in the pseudocode for the MTC0 instruction. • Add note to indicate that the CACHE instruction does not take Address Error Excep- tions due to mis-aligned effective addresses. • Update SRL, ROTR, SRLV, ROTRV, DSRL, DROTR, DSRLV, DROTRV, DSRL32, and DROTR32 instructions to reflect a 1-bit, rather than a 4-bit decode of shift vs. rotate function. • Add programming note to the PrepareForStore PREF hint to indicate that it cannot be used alone to create a bzero-like operation. • Add note to the PREF and PREFX instruction indicating that they may cause Bus Error and Cache Error exceptions, although this is typically limited to systems with high-reliability requirements. • Update the SYNCI instruction to indicate that it should not modify the state of a locked cache line. • Establish specific rules for when multiple TLB matches can be reported (on writes only). This makes software handling easier. 2.50 July 1, 2005 Changes in this revision: • Correct figure label in LWR instruction (it was incorrectly specified as LWL). • Update all files to FrameMaker 7.1. • Include support for implementation-dependent hardware registers via RDHWR. • Indicate that it is implementation-dependent whether prefetch instructions cause EJTAG data breakpoint exceptions on an address match, and suggest that the pre- ferred implementation is not to cause an exception. • Correct the MIPS32 pseudocode for the LDC1, LDXC1, LUXC1, SDC1, SDXC1, and SUXC1 instructions to reflect the Release 2 ability to have a 64-bit FPU on a 32- bit CPU. The correction simplifies the code by using the ValueFPR and StoreFPR functions, which correctly implement the Release 2 access to the FPRs. • Add an explicit recommendation that all cache operations that require an index be done by converting the index to a kseg0 address before performing the cache opera- tion. • Expand on restrictions on the PREF instruction in cases where the effective address has an uncached coherency attribute. • Revision Date Description ","Revision History 468 The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 2.60 June 25, 2008 Changes in this revision: • Applied the new B0.01 template. • Update RDHWR description with the UserLocal register. • added PAUSE instruction • Ordering SYNCs • CMP behavior of CACHE, PREF*, SYNCI • CVT.S.PL, CVT.S.PU are non-arithmetic (no exceptions) • *MADD.fmt & *MSUB fmt are non-fused. • various typos fixed 2.61 July 10, 2008 • Revision History file was incorrectly copied from Volume III. • Removed index conditional text from PAUSE instruction description. • SYNC instruction - added additional format “SYNC stype” 2.62 January 2, 2009 • LWC1, LWXC1 - added statement that upper word in 64bit registers are UNDE- FINED. • CVT.S.PL and CVT.S.PU descriptions were still incorrectly listing IEEE exceptions. • Typo in CFC1 Description. • CCRes is accessed through $3 for RDHWR, not $4. 3.00 March 25, 2010 • JALX instruction description added. • Sub-setting rules updated for JALX. • 3.01 June 01, 2010 • Copyright page updated. • User mode instructions not allowed to produce UNDEFINED results, only UNPRE- DICTABLE results. 3.02 March 21, 2011 • RECIP, RSQRT instructions do not require 64-bit FPU. • MADD/MSUB/NMADD/NMSUB pseudo-code was incorrect for PS format check. 3.50 September 20, 2012 • Added EVA load/store instructions: LBE, LBUE, LHE, LHUE, LWE, SBE, SHE, SWE, CACHEE, PREFE, LLE, SCE, LWLE, LWRE, SWLE, SWRE. • TLBWI - can be used to invalidate the VPN2 field of a TLB entry. • FCSR.MAC2008 bit affects intermediate rounding in MADD.fmt, MSUB fmt, NMADD.fmt and NMSUB.fmt. • FCSR.ABS2008 bit defines whether ABS fmt and NEG.fmt are arithmetic or not (how they deal with QNAN inputs). 3.51 October 20, 2012 • CACHE and SYNCI ignore RI and XI exceptions. • CVT, CEIL, FLOOR, ROUND, TRUNC to integer can’t generate FP-Overflow exception. 5.00 December 14, 2012 • R5 changes: DSP and MT ASEs -> Modules • NMADD.fmt, NMSUB fmt - for IEEE2008 negate portion is arithmetic. 5.01 December 15, 2012 • No technical content changes: • Update logos on Cover. • Update copyright page. 5.02 April 22, 2013 • Fix: Figure 2.26 Are64BitFPOperationsEnabled Pseudcode Function - “Enabled” was missing. • R5 change retroactive to R3: removed FCSR.MCA2008 bit: no architectural support for fused multiply add with no intermediate rounding. Applies to MADD fmt, MSUB fmt, NMADD fmt, NMSUB fmt. • Clarification: references to “16 FP registers mode” changed to “the FR=0 32-bit reg- ister model”; specifically, paired single (PS) instructions and long (L) format instruc- tions have UNPREDICTABLE results if FR=0, as well as LUXC1and SUXC1. • Clarification: C.cond fmt instruction page: cond bits 2..1 specify the comparison, cond bit 0 specifies ordered versus unordered, while cond bit 3 specifies signaling versus non-signaling. • R5 change: UFR (User mode FR change): CFC1, CTC1 changes.

Known issues: • This draft describes Release 6, as well as earlier releases of the MIPS architecture. E.g. instructions that were present in MIPSr5 but which were removed in Release 6 are still in the manual, although they should be clearly marked “removed by Release 6” to indicate that they have been removed by Release 6. • R6U new instruction pseudocode is 64-bit, rather than 32-bit, albeit attempting to use notations that apply to both. • Certain new instruction descriptions are “unsplit”, describing families of instructions such as all compact branches, rather than separate descriptions of each instruction. This facilitates comparison and consistency, but currently allows certain MIPS64 Release 6 instructions to appear inappropriately in the MIPS32 Release 6 manual. A future release of the manual will “split” these instruction family descriptions, e.g. the compact branch family will be split up into at least 12 different instruction descrip- tions. • R6U requires misalignment support for all ordinary memory reference instructions, but the pseudocode does not yet reflect this. Boilerplate has been added to all existing instructions saying this. • The new R6U PC-relative loads (LWP, LWUP, LDP) in this draft incorrectly say that misaligned accesses are permitted. Revision Date Description ","The MIPS32® Instruction Set Manual, Revision 6.06 473 R6U-pre- release draft Feb. 13, 2014 • ALIGN/DALIGN: clarified bp=0 behavior • ALIGN/DALIGN pseudocode used || as logical OR rather than MIPS’ pseudocode concatenate. • Removed incorrect note about not using r31 as a source register to BAL. • Release 6 requires BC1EQZ/BC1NEZ if an FPU is present, i.e. they cannot signal RI. • R6U 1.05 change: BC1EQZ/BC1NEZ test only bit 0 of the FPY; changed from test- ing if any bit nonzero; helps with trap-and-emulate of DP on an SP-only FPU. • Known problem: R6U 1.05 change not yet made: all 32-bit FP operations leave upper bits of 64 bit FOR and./or 128-bit MSR unpredictable; helps with trap-and-emulate of DP on an SP-only FPU. • Clearly marked all .PS instructions as removed via removed by Release 6 in instruc- tion format. • DMUL, DMULTU, DDIV, DDIVU marked removed by Release 6 • Started using =Release 6 notation to indicate that an instruction has been changed but is still present. JR.HB =Release 6, aliased to JALR.HB. SSNOP =Release 6, treated as NOP. • Noted that BLTZAL and BGEZAL are removed by Release 6, the special cases NAL=BLTZAL with rs=0 and BAL=BGEZAL with rs=0, remain supported by Release 6. • Marked conditional traps with immediate removed by Release 6. • Overeager propagation of r31 restriction to non-call instructions5 removed. • Emphasized that unconditional compact CTIs have neither delay slot nor forbidden slot. • SDBBP updated for R6P facility to disable if no hardware debug trap handler • UFR/UNFR (User-mode FR facility) disallowed in Release 6: changes to CTC1 and CFC1 instructions.
